# BERTopic Output 

Here are some visualizations from BERTopic analysis of the Round 3 (Climate Fiction) texts. Prior to analysis, these texts were split into 1000-word "chunks" per chapter, since BERTopic does better with smaller pieces of data. These texts were kept in aggregated form and all non-English words were removed. Stopwords were removed after BERTopic analysis occurred.

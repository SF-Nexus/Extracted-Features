    "\n",
    "Dividing texts into sections (for example, chapters or chunks of N length) is valuable as a precursor to topic modeling and other forms of computational analysis which perform more accurately when applied to groups of segmented documents from longer texts. \n",

    "**Why Disaggregate Texts?** \n",

    "The process of disaggregating the words in texts (in this case, by alphabetizing them) also creates data sets that can be shared freely where original texts cannot be due to copyright restrictions. \n",

    "This code requires plain txt files as input, either those from this repository's sample_data folder or those from a local machine. It returns csv files with disaggregated text grouped by chapter or chunk of n length."

    "# Clean Texts and Set Parameters for Sectioning \n",
    "Several basic cleaning processes are implemented: removing unwanted characters from titles, removing newline characters from texts, and removing punctuation. Parameters are also set for part(s) of text to be included in sectioning. In the SciFi Corpus project, \"START OF BOOK\" and \"END OF BOOK\" tags were added to delineate the body of each text. Code in this section removes any text outside the starting and ending parameters--e.g., title page, copyright page, other paratext. "

       "' PART The Long Voyage CHAPTER Gone are the days when a nameless continent lay beyond the ocean and then a nameless ocean beyond that continent days smelling of spices  I remember a time in the Cape Verde Islands when the tackle struck against the yardarm while the wind whistled a strange tune in the rigging and then there was water nothing but water water without end from horizon to horizon shining like a sea of quicksilver in the calm of the noonday sun  The sea was motionless for weeks and then a slight breeze got up little more than a breath hardly enough to swell out our slack sails  But it was the breath of the wind rousing itself to drive us on and away from all we knew  So long ago Cape Horn and at noon it was dark as night  A salty mist rose above our bows as the foaming waves broke over them and the hungry sea roared crashing on the black rocks  Or perhaps it was not the sea roaring but some terrible unknown thing though in our madness we longed to know it even at the price of our lives  So long ago       those days when we chewed on thin strips of leather becalmed in the middle of the endless ocean our teeth loose in our dry mouths our swollen tongues bobbing about like corks  Then the life-giving storm broke  St Elmos fire the fire of the Prophet Elijah came licking its way along all the masts and yards  Wonderful fresh water flowed from the sails and down our burning throats  What a thirst we hada thirst for life Life did I say No men who wanted life stayed in Lisbon Palos or Cadiz  Those hot spices that aroused our thirst grew somewhere else somewhere far beyond the horizon and no one ever tasted them but those of us who gave the nameless oceans and the unknown lands their names  CHAPTER 1 Our long voyage began with fire the age-old symbol of the conqueror  Our ship left a trail of burning gas behind it like a foaming wake in the depths of the black ocean of space while we headed for the light of the shining stars  I was trying to keep my mind firmly fixed on something but my thoughts were caught in a spiders web of uncertainty  The one firm reality was the metal of the seat into which I was tightly strapped  I dont want to get too personal but I thought that as the expeditions doctor I ought to be clear about my own feelings if I was to understand those of others  I knew how things can be faked after the event with banners and laurel wreaths and fine speeches and I knew too that it was a combination of chances both lucky and unlucky as well as hard work and many sacrifices that had got me my place among the conquerors of space  Still was it really possible to feel nothing but pleasure at the idea of being one of those to extend the boundaries of the world of humanity Im a sceptic I didnt think we could do any such thing in space before extending the boundaries of our inner worlds  However I wasnt thinking of ethics as I sat there in the anti-gravitation seat feeling the pressure weighing heavy on my chest and the air being expelled from my lungs  One cant think at all at such a moment  All I felt was a sense of heaviness and exhaustion  My brain had become a lump of lead filling every cranny of my skull  But it did not last long the heaviness began to go away with a pain that brought relief and gradually turned to a state of weightlessness  I was light as a feather  Something glittered on the retina of my eyes  My thoughts were in suspension out of somewhere there came the picture of a harbour with a convoy of sailing ships setting out  It could have been Lisbon       Over the ships side I saw a colourful crowd waving good-bye  Good-bye for ever perhaps  Still it was a sweet moment       The masts were creaking overhead the foresail rustling in the brisk morning wind  Gulls circled round the ship their harsh cries scarcely distinguishable from the creaking of the rigging  The harbour grew smaller and smaller until the little town was only a picture a miniature of the coast and the sky  Then there was nothing left but a white streak on the horizon nothing but the infinite blue of sea and sky above and below and a constant rocking motion       The green light flashing on the control panel in front of me told me that those days were long past  Days when distant lands smelled of spices  Yet though all the oceans and continents of Earth now have names an equally mysterious enticing unknown lies beyond our own horizons and the noses of our spaceships were aimed at the planet Mars a mysterious island in the boundless spaces of the cosmic ocean  Such islands are still virgin territory distant places still lure us on  There are still Capes of Good Hope to be found and nameless rocks a new Sargasso Sea treacherous sandbanks storms calms St Elmos fire hunger thirst and refreshing rain  A voice from the loudspeaker broke into my relaxed awareness like an electric shock  It was an announcement from the main control room  The metallic quality of the voice filtered and reproduced again by electrons wrenched me out of my thoughts and brought me back to reality  It was a voice Id be hearing for two hundred and fifty-eight days  I was sitting alone in the cramped cabin that was to act as our surgery wondering if my nineteen companions were having similar experiences  Wed been through a long training simulating a real flight in every respectand yet now it was all different  The moment I had dreamed of for years didnt look the same any more  Even in a condition of weightlessness it was charged with the weight of reality  Programme Three Jenkins the radio engineer reported that all was going to plan on the mother ship and the five freighters  According to his announcement the readings taken during our passage through the Van Allen Belt showed that radiation danger was over so we could take the hatches off the portholes  I unfastened the belt holding me into my seat  As I wasnt on duty at the moment I thought Id go to the observatory there was no porthole in my cabin which was specially equipped as a surgery  The first twenty thousand kilometres of our voyage were already behind us and I wanted to look at Earth like a sailor putting out to sea who looks back at the harbour  As I walked out of the cabin into the gangway I ought to say that the idea of walking is purely a convention in weightlessness I heard the voice of Major Ralph Norton the expeditions captain through the loudspeaker giving orders to jettison the booster fuel tanks now that they were empty they were just so much superfluous ballast  I met my colleague Watts the expeditions other doctor at the end of the dimly lit gangway  I was to look after the crews general mental and physical health while Watts was responsible for the surgical side  As he floated past the porthole his head in its helmet with the visor open reminded me of some dark old portrait of a knight in armour  Hullo George said Watts with rather forced cheerfulness  Well how does it feel to see the mainland disappear from sight He was obviously feeling much the same as mea harbour disappearing over the horizon an endless expanse of ocean   I asked him to go along to the observatory with me but he refused  No need to worry about me he said  He meant in my capacity as the expeditions psychiatrist  Then he asked what I thought of our new captain  How do you mean new captain I asked  Hes the only one weve had so far Well yes said Watts  Still everyone did expect OBrien to get the job  This was true  Just twenty-four hours ago after long deliberations the directors of Project Alpha had appointed Major Norton leader of the expedition  The other candidate for the post William OBrien was appointed second-in-command and put in charge of the scientific research mission  During our training period he had been provisional commander  I knew what Watts meant OBrien was an older more experienced astronaut than Norton an outstanding authority on biology a strong uncompromising character  Yet Ralph Norton had been appointed over his head  Norton had one great advantage over OBrien he had served in the Army  He was determined alert and cold-blooded rather cool even to his friends  McKinley our geologist used to say jokingly that he was about as warm as a dogs muzzle  There was a crush in the narrow gangway leading to the door of the observatory though the word crush is only relative considering the tiny size of the spaceships cabins  Morphy and McKinley were outside the observatory door both floating upright and holding on to the handrails which were installed in all gangways throughout the ship  It was an unwritten law between astronauts that when you met you manoeuvred yourselves so that your heads were the same way up its unnerving to talk to someone who appears to be upside down his face looks distorted especially when he moves his eyes and mouth  McKinley grinned at me  What another nostalgic spaceman Well have to wait a bit  OBrien and Compton are in there saying good-bye to the Old Lady     There was a magnificent view from the observatory  Its large portholes made it possible to see all round the ship  We could see the whole group of five freighters connected to the mother ship by an ingenious structure so as to form one gigantic star-shaped body of shining metal  Above them in the blackness of space hung the planet Earth now more than thirty thousand kilometres away  From here it looked like a bluish phosphorescent globe  The outline of the west coast of Africa shone through the bluish haze of the Earths atmosphere  The equatorial regions of the Atlantic Ocean and Central Africa were covered in thick cloud and so was Europe but the Sahara desert shone golden yellow in the sun  The Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America were still shrouded in the deep night covering the western side of the globe but a few parts of the glaciers of the Cordilleras were just beginning to glitter in the morning sun  None of us uttered a word and I dont think it was just the beauty of the sight that kept us silent  It was the thought that we were the first men ever to leave the home planet for as long as nearly a thousand days  Even the experienced McKinley who had been around on the Moon did not break the silence  Work on the booster tanks was going well  Men in black spacesuits firmly fastened to cables were hovering among the metal structures connecting the spaceships  They relieved each other every thirty minutes  One huge cylinder had already been detached and cast off and was swimming around us in space slowly drifting away from us  It isnt easy to imagine the fantastic speed at which the vast convoy of connected spaceships was racing soundlessly on  There was no visible point of reference to show us that we were moving except the motionless sun the almost imperceptible movement of the Moon and the fact that Earth was gradually becoming smaller  About an hour later I had another chance to watch the dismantling of the booster tanks  The scene was unchanged except that the first cylinder to be cast off was now floating in space about a hundred metres off  With nothing around us to give a sense of perspective we could judge its distance from us only by its reduced size  As I watched the cylinder drifting in the dark expanses of the ocean of space I was reminded of a bottle thrown from a ship into the sea  Only this bottle would float orbiting the sun for thousands perhaps millions of years  Like a message or a souvenir like a relic of life from a long-dead planet orbiting a now ageing sun  And as nothing in space is entirely obliterated some time this cylinder would either end its wanderings on one of the bodies of the solar system or be changed to dust or gas or energy  Work on the booster tanks went on for five and a half hours  Meanwhile the convoy of spaceships in its parabolic flight had gone over half the distance between Earth and the Moon  Luckily all the crew were kept so busy at the moment that none of us had time to think how far we were racing away from Earth with every second  The sight of Earth as a globe getting smaller and smaller in the blackness of space was not new to any of usyet this time there was something else about it something quite new       The last silvery gleaming cylinder drifted slowly away  By now the first tank to be cast off was only the glint of a bright star on the black horizon  CHAPTER 2 The motionless sun was shining brightly  It neither rose nor set it kept radiating immense quantities of energy out into space which we describe as empty  However the instruments on board the mother ship meticulously recorded the presence of micro-meteorites cosmic dust gases and radiation  But to the human eye there was no point of reference beyond the body of the ship nothing but a perilous vacuum  However the rhythms of human life the alternation of day and night work and relaxation must not be broken  The ships clock showed the timewhite for day blue for nightand the date of the day on Earth  The same clock regulated our periods on and off duty  At eight in the morning Captain Norton came to my surgery  He looked tired but remarkably he was smiling  As usual he had shaved carefully  McKinley came for his check-up after the captain  As usual he found it difficult to keep serious McKinley always had to find something to joke about  He described my surgery as a nuthouse and said Id have a great future once the pills I was feeding to the expedition began to take effect  McKinley was followed by Wellgarth the astrophysicist then came Glennon our chief engineer and so on until midday  Then there was a two-hour break for dinner and recreation  Since each mans daily check-up took nearly three-quarters of an hour at this stage of the voyage and there were twenty members of the expedition Watts and I had our hands full  The mother ships crew consisted of ten men and there were two on each of the five freighters they were relieved daily by crew members from the other ship among other reasons so that our cramped living quarters and the conditions of our flight wouldnt give rise to psychic complications  The largest room in the mother ship and a series of sleeping-cabins were given over to the crews main periods of recreation and sleep they were equipped with air-conditioning systems which meant that the astronauts could relax without spacesuits  But we still had to come to terms with the discomfort of weightlessness for the duration of the flight  While Im on the subject of the crews physical well-being and the provision made for it I must mention that we all had to make do with a kind of washing-paste for our daily hygiene  The water re-cycling system was working perfectly but the ten tons of water carried on each freighter represented the bare minimum to support life for the whole expedition  A tub of hot water was to be a beautiful mirage for some time to come  At 2 00 p m  a message for the whole crew came over the loudspeaker  Jenkins announced that the captain had decided to ban all members of the expedition from the observatory for three days except Wellgarth the astrophysicist and the planetologist Compton  Immediately afterwards Jenkins added that the captain had reprimanded two of the engineers Mack Sheldon and Irwin Trott  I didnt know what to make of this at all  I wondered if Compton and Wellgarth had complained of being disturbed in their work but I abandoned that idea at once neither of them would have done it that way  Putting the observatory out of bounds while they were at work there would have been quite enough  When Sheldon came for his check-up I found out what was really behind the ban  Trott had had eight hours off duty after his exhausting period of work in a heavy spacesuit disconnecting the booster tanks  He spent the greater part of this time at the telescope in the observatory watching Earth gradually recede behind us  The resulting eyestrain gave him a bad headache  He went to Watts for tablets and Watts supposing that the headache was something to do with working in deep space reported it to the captain  One of the basic rules of our expedition was not to underestimate any detail however small  It was only later that the captain learned the true facts from the well-meant teasing of Trotts friends and Sheldons comically exaggerated account of the affair  He put the observatory out of bounds and reprimanded both men Trott for wilfully departing from the programme laid down for him and Sheldon for making fun of his comrade  I had some trouble disposing of Sheldons sense of grievance he claimed that he never had any intention of making Trott look silly and the captain couldnt take a joke  However he finally admitted that perhaps he had hurt Trotts feelings a bit  By now our convoy of spaceships had put two and a half million kilometres of its semi-elliptical course behind ita dizzy number by Earth standards but out in space it didnt have enough noughts in it yet  It was a depressing moment when Earth shrank to become only one among all the glittering points of light in a black desert with the sun glaring harshly in the middle of it  We call it the life-giving sun on Earth but in this desolate wilderness it was just a light  Messages from Earth reached us every day our radio communications with Mission Control were working well  Endless rows of figures came and went on invisible waves computers flashed and tapped as the Old Lady talked to us  Our high spirits the intoxication of the first few hours and days gradually began to give way to the pressures of hard reality  The thought that we were the first human beings out in this wilderness dead for millions of years was inspiring all right but disquieting too  In the interests of the whole company the ships rules laid down that all those off duty would gather for the main meal of the day in the largest of the mother ships cabins which we had christened The Club to keep our spirits up  When I walked inor rather floated injust before six OBrien and several other crew members were already sitting there  Yes they were sitting seats clamped to the floor and a contraption like the harness in a babys high chair made sitting possible under conditions of weightlessness  It was the only way to create an illusion of normality in such conditions and that was an important factor  Today McKinley was on duty as cook waiter barman and juggler  We were all issued with our rations  The food was plastic-wrapped and kept down on the trays with sticky tape  McKinley obviously enjoyed serving the drinks they were in plastic sachets which he threw through the air towards us so neatly that they came floating right up to our faces  I guessed hed have been quite happy to take on the job of waiter for the whole trip  However our mealtimes in space were not very elegant we had to get the food from the openings of the packets straight into our mouths  Small particles swimming around our heads could have made breathing very dangerous  When Sheldon and Trott came in McKinley greeted them with a remark that made both men smile rather guiltily  He informed them that they were a blot on the pure white of the expeditions recordand then turned to the second-in-command  Oh Lord he said  Now how am I going to be punished for saying that From anyone but McKinley it might have sounded more of a criticism than a joke  OBrien just smiled  You he said  Why youd never get out of the punishment block at allyoud still have nine hundred and sixty days to serve after we got back We talked in a friendly way over our suppersomething as essential to ones pleasure at mealtimes as light or warmth  I believe civilisation really began at the moment when Man stopped masticating his prey in some comer of his cave and began to share his food and his thoughts with other people  I was watching OBrien all the time  The man fascinated me  He had an odd tone of voice he never tried convincing you of anything by using crushing arguments  You got the impression he was simply putting forward his thoughts for an opinion on them offering them for consideration and in his capacity as the captains second-in-command he never issued strict orders   no OBrien was not the stuff of which commanders are made  CHAPTER 3 It would be ridiculous to say the least to find a scientific expedition equipped by the most modem technology for the purpose of landing on Mars bothering about the existence or otherwise of unlucky numbers  Im quite well aware that its rather disreputable for a man with some claim to academic honours to describe the thirteenth day of our flight as a black day  On the morning of the thirteenth day Mission Control reported a small error in the parameters of our flight and gave precise directions for its correction  The flight correction motors were fired and after a few moments we sent detailed readings back to Earth where the computers at Mission Control began to tap out a reporta disturbing one for us  And then much as I hate to mention it along came unlucky number thirteen  My duty period ended at noon that day  After eating I went to the observatory where I had a date with Wellgarth  He had a new idea about Einsteins theory of relativity which he wanted to put to me it was something that interested me a lot as a psychiatrist  We hadnt been talking for five minutes when the alarm buzzer sounded in every cabin of the ship and at the same time the control room gave the Man overboard signal  Wellgarth and I made for the portholes  There was a figure in a spacesuit floating above the shining structure that held the star-shaped convoy together  We could tell from the number on his back that it was Vaux from the fifth freighter  We saw him waving the rocket gun we all carried in the thigh pockets of our spacesuits during a spacewalk to make movement feasible in a weightless environment  It looked as if the gun was out of order  Vaux was hovering in space without a safety rope waving his hands helplessly kicking his legs and beginning to float away from us quite fast  It was a terrifying sight  Immediately afterwards we heard the captains voice giving orders for a rescue operation  Williams the first engineer on the fifth ship plunged into the black emptiness on the end of a hundred-metre rope  We saw the flash of his first rocket  Vaux was getting further away all the time  I judged that he was over a hundred metres off by now  Apparently the captain thought so too for even before Williamss hundred-metre rope was stretched taut the captain told him to cast himself off  So now there were two men swimming in the bottomless ocean of space neither with a safety rope I was so tense that I did not hear the captains voice issuing further commands but I saw a flash that accelerated Williamss movement and another that changed its direction  Both men were certainly outside the hundred metre area by now and getting further away all the time  My throat felt so dry that I could hardly swallow  Lawrenson another of the engineers pushed off from the second freighter fastened to an extended rope  Meanwhile Williams was getting closer to his companion  He missed him by ten metres  Firing his rocket gun he corrected course until he could grab hold of the drifting man  I lost count of the number of rockets fired in my excitement cold shudders ran down my back at the thought that Williamss gun might go wrong too  It flashed again and the two men in their spacesuits were turning slowly on the spot gleaming in the sunlight against the dark background like two strange deep-sea fish  There was something uncanny about the sight  Another flashand at last we could see the shipwrecked Vaus and his rescuer coming closer  About a hundred metres from the convoy they met Lawrenson and they all came back safely secured to the rope by latch hooks  Im not sure just how long the whole operation lasted but I felt as though Id lived through several nerve-racking hours and I was certain that but for the captains swift decision in giving Williams the risky order to cast himself off from the safety rope we should have had a tragic accident  At that moment I felt enormous respect for Captain Norton  Later on I learned how the accident had happened  The freighter crews were relieved every day and the men would swim back to the mother ship in their spacesuits with sliding latch hooks fastened to the connecting rope  Vaux who seemed to attract bad luck as we knew from a whole series of minor accidents during our training had not fastened his hook to the rope properly  At the moment when he pushed off gently to get back to the mother ship he realised that he was not on the rope at all  Struggling to get back to the freighter he kicked his feet a movement which in itself pushed him off from the hull of the freighter and out into deep space  He told me later that at that moment he remembered his friends saying that something nasty was sure to happen to him because it was our thirteenth day  And suddenly said Vaux he was overwhelmed by a doomed feeling a sense of fear  I just knew the gun wasnt going to work he told me  But it turns out that it wasnt out of order at all I objected  It was just the safety catch sticking more than wed normally expect  Vaux smiled  Normally What do you call normal out there Youre a psychologist arent you You should know people have a right to behave abnormally now and then Williams was commended for his courage  Vaux was reprimanded for negligence of the safety regulations and only allowed to do minor routine jobs for the time being  There was another side to this incident and one that particularly interested me  At the moment when the Man overboard signal came Captain Norton OBrien and Jenkins the radio engineer were all in the captains cabin  When the captain gave Williams the order to cast off from the rope OBrien could not help mut- tering My God what a risk At that Jenkins told me the captain looked like a stone statue  When the rescue operation was over he turned to OBrien  Yes it was a risk he said  It was also the only solution  Take over now will you And he left the cabin  Later OBrien apologised in front of Jenkins  The captain thanked him but replied in a chilly voice You dont have to apologise you know  You were right it was a risk  Then he buried himself in his study of the navigational charts  From that day on it seemed as if we had come under some evil influence  There was something unknown lurking in the dead wastes around us  It got through the toughened glass of the ships inner hatches it seeped in like some gas or fluid which we could not stop  I guessed what it was the insidious infection of space sickness which thrives in the artificial environment of cramped cabins unchanging light the monotonous blinking tapping and humming of instruments and the sameness of the crews words and actions  I discovered the first symptom of space sickness in Morphy one evening  We were playing a game of chess in the Club after supper using small magnetic pieces on a metal chessboard  When Morphy lost for the second time he swept the pieces off the board shouting furiously These chessmen are hopelessfar too small Isnt there even room for a decent game of chess here I knew how infectious the thing was  That very evening by arrangement with the captain I gave an impromptu lecture in the Club about the well-known hazards of submarine sickness  I hoped it would be a kind of mental disinfectant I wanted to draw attention in a casual way to the serious danger threatening us if we let our surroundings and our gloomy forebodings get us down  The microphone was connected up to the radio system so that I could be heard all over the convoy  Thanks to McKinleys interruptions which were very much to the point and helped to put my ideas more cogently the evening went off very well in fact when the crews of the freighters got back to the mother ship next day they said we could do with a floor show like that every evening  The monotonous passage of time with no alternation of night and day no sunrise or sunset no clouds or rustling leaves washed over our feelings as if to wear us down like flat stones  Hour by hour it ground down that wealth of individuality given to every human being  Twenty days forty daysthere were still more than two hundred such days to go  The romance of this great adventure of humanity disappeared from our minds the sight of the black desolation of space through the portholes was devastating in its effect  Once it even gave me the idea that we were standing still in space held fast by an unknown power in some unknown force field at a spot where the power of inertia was neutralised at a zero point of energy where nothing was anything  Of course this was abysmal nonsense but my notion frightened meless in itself than simply because of the fact that Id thought it up  I told myself we had a long and really difficult voyage ahead  In theory concentrated work is the best preventive for space sickness or so we always said in the medical profession back on Earth  Back on Earth everything works all right  But you just cant simulate a long interplanetary flightthe training lacks the essential factor the continuous trying pressure of reality  Shut up twenty men in an underground vault say for a year  They have work food and drink air companyand the knowledge that if things become unbearable they can give up drop everything and go back to the outside world  Send them on a years practice flight around the Earth  Theyre weightless all the time they go through all the tests and do all the jobs theyd have to do on an interplanetary flight but today or tomorrow they can cut it short and come back down below the clouds  However we couldnt possibly get back be- fore nine hundred and sixty days were up  And then only if all went well  An important if  One good way to safeguard our mental balance was general conversation so every cabin of every ship was connected to the rest by microphone as well as loudspeaker  This meant that even the crews of the freighters could join in the talk their duties were relatively light at this stage of the voyage unless you considered that the attendant monotony made things worse if anything  We would discuss our stay on Mars a subject that always invigorated everyone  Or we talked about the technical problems of future cosmonautics which was Captain Nortons hobby horse  OBrien liked talking philosophy which could be hard going but was interestingthough sometimes our earnest discussions would go astray and wed find ourselves passing from interplanetary means of transport to cars on Earth and so to a passionate argument about sports car performances  We often talked about cooking which was not surprising considering what our food on board was likeonce Watts who had been a dab hand at grilling a steak even when he was a student indulged in such a vivid description that we all voted to throw him overboard  On another occasion McKinley got talking about the impossibly old-fashioned look of mens wear and threatened to open a mens boutique when he got back to Earth and launch the Martian Look  The light-hearted chat was just as good for us as the serious discussions  We held a small celebration on the fifty-eighth day of our flight  Only two hundred days left to go  The captain and his second-in-command were both present at supper and we all talked cheerfully  Watching the two men who carried the main burden of responsibility for the success of the Mars shot I realised that the Project Alpha directors had made a good choice  The two leaders complemented each other one had energy courage and decision and the other a deep humanitarian understanding of life  What more could we ask I went to the captain at midday the next day  I wanted to discuss a report I was making to Mission Control I was going to ask permission to change the psychological tests  When wed dealt with that Briggs one of the engineers came in to ask the captain to excuse him from going on duty with Gray  He seemed badly upset and when the captain asked him to give a reason for his odd request he just said Well I cant spend twelve hours a day with a nut like that I simply cant stick it The captain was silent for a few moments  Youd be sorry you said that in normal circumstances Briggs he said at last and added turning to me Look youd better see about this  Theres something wrong with him  Gray too  I asked Gray to come to the surgery first he was a more equable character than Briggs and when I asked him to tell me what the matter was without getting all worked up he didnt object to my recording his statement on tape for study purposes  Gray complained that he and Briggs hadnt been getting along for some time  However in the interests of a peaceful life he Gray would often agree with what Briggs said odd as it might be  But Briggs had been very jittery latelyit looked as if he were positively trying to pick a quarrel  Hes an excellent engineer yet yesterday he was arguing over a detail which he must have known made technological nonsense  We ended up with a hysterical scene Then I started in on Briggs  This is part of his remarks on tape  briggs Switch that thing off  Im not crazy  You dont need me in your files  me Who said you were crazy Briggs All these records serve a scientific purpose  I have records of Captain Norton here and OBrien       Im telling you this to make my point so that youll briggs Well I wont  Turn it off me I cant force you but its a pity  Might amuse you later when youre sitting by the fire back at home briggs Doc for the last time will you turn that off before I smash the thing upand you can wipe that tape out too I turned the recorder off  Then we had a long talk and Briggs gradually calmed down  He had space sickness all right  As I succeeded in gaining his confidence he admitted to suffering from frequent lack of breath and the fear of something he couldnt quite define  He felt better after a quarrel with Gray as if some kind of unendurable inner tension were released  He had the feeling that Gray was laughing at him belittling him  Here I interrupted him and ran through Grays account of it on tape  A straightforward friendly statement no double meanings no insinuations and it made an unexpectedly strong impression on Briggs  I thought he was really rather moved  Then suddenly as if hed had an electric shock he said Here is this some kind of psychological trick of yours Wasnt Gray reading out something you wrote down for him I was at a loss until I decided I had only to say what I was thinking  Briggsdont you think I ought to have you in my files after all Think about it Oh forget it said Briggs at once  I shouldnt have been like that to a friend  If Gray has no objections well carry on working together  CHAPTER 4 Certain changes in the blood count only slight at present were beginning to appear in some members of the expedition  There had been exhaustive research into the condition of weightlessness during long flights round Earth but this time the compensatory measures we had to take didnt seem to be one hundred per cent efficient  I consulted Watts and Mission Control  It was probably the result of psychological stress  We increased the affected mens dosage of drugs       and we werent even half way to Mars yet  The evening celebrations on the hundredth day of our flight were a dismal failure  For one thing it was much too like any other ordinary evening in the Club and for another a fault had shown up in the main thermostat regulating the temperature in the mother ships cabins  Within an hour it had sunk from twenty to fifteen degrees  Silcott who was responsible for the instruments of this system was sweating as he looked for the cause of the trouble  We had to switch over to the spare circuit  Suppose we couldnt eliminate the fault suppose the reserve plant gave out too       the insulation of the mother ship could not hold out for long against the bitter cold of space  The effect on the whole crew was amazing  No one said a word we all went about looking abstracted as if we were mentally counting the components where a fault might show upsome slight defect a malicious gremlin lurking somewhere  After an hour and a half Silcott announced that he had eliminated the fault  The insulation of a switch had been damaged  Everything was all rightso long as we didnt find ourselves thinking of all the hundred thousand component parts of the ship upon which all our lives depended  Personally I was having more trouble with the complexities of the human brain than the steely nervous system of the ship and her hidden illnesses  I got the impression that relationships between the men were somehow becoming stereotyped almost robot-like  We were polite to each other but that was about all  I found it was difficult for me to laugh at anyone and I didnt feel the least need for any gesture of friendship either  I was doing my duty and no more  Intensive thought tired me  From time to time I tried to analyse myself out of this apathy but I couldnt get to the root of the trouble  My attempts at self-analysis left me with nothing but an unpleasant headache and persistent depression over the oppressive feeling that something was wrong  We needed something to give a different rhythm to our lives  A change did come not unfortunately like refreshing rain after a sultry day more like a thunderstorm brewing  New calculations came up from Mission Control we had to make another course correction  We could hear the captains and the engineers voices over the loudspeaker  Long rows of figures countdowns orders and the repetition of orders  Then flame shot out of the jets  The actual course correction manoeuvre usually lasted only a few seconds  I was watching the stars through one of the portholes and I could tell when the engines were being fired from their movement  Then the signals system began to buzz  I heard a couple of orders which I didnt understand  But the movement of the stars as seen through the porthole did not stop in fact it was getting faster and faster  Now the sun appeared in the porthole too describing a great arc across the sky like a comet in slow motion  Then stars again and then the sun once more  Stars and sun gathered momentum  I realised that the whole starshaped convoy was turning like a gigantic roundabout and at the same time I felt centrifugal force pushing me against the cabin wall towards the outer rim of the star-shaped structure  Suddenly I had a terrestrial feeling a sense of mass and weight  The alarm on the convoy roused the whole crew  Something was wrong with the closure mechanism of the jets on the third freighters correction motor and its uncontrollable force had sent the whole convoy bound together as it was into a single steel structure into a rotating movement  After a short time I heard over the loudspeaker that they had managed to shut off the jets  But the rotating motion did not stop it would not stop of its own accord for a thousand years which meant that the overall mass of the convoy was now un-steerable  As I wasnt one of the expeditions technological experts I hurried off to the observatory to get a better view  This was not too easy because of the centrifugal force produced by the rotation no sooner did I let go of the handrail than I slid along the wall of the gangway and felt a dull pain in one knee  Watts and Well-garth were in the observatory  Both were silent  Soon we heard the voice of Glennon the chief engineer from the main control room  The captain had obviously handed over command of the technical side of the rescue operation to him  We heard Glennon give orders to fire the third freighters correction motor  The pull of this engine would go against the direction of the rotation and its thrust might brake the movement of the whole convoy  That was just what happened  Quite soon the movement of the stars began to slow down  Then we heard the captain talking to Glennon discussing whether or not to give the engine another bum at Force Two  I thought the captains voice sounded different from usual there was an underlying note of uncertainty in itor rather distrust  That wasnt hard to understand  He was a model commander a man who felt responsible for everything even decisions he had not taken himself so if he had decided to hand over command of this whole tricky operation to the chief engineer it was certainly not in order to let himself out  Glennon gave the word to switch to Force Two  After a second or so the movement of the stars practically stopped  But at the same time looking through the big porthole of the observatory we saw the connecting structure at the back of the third freighter burst apart and begin to break away from the hull of the mother ship  The order to stop the engines at once halted this dangerous development immediatelybut the rear of the freighter was turning slowly inexorably to one side pulled by the last lingering remnants of centrifugal force  A long rent gaped open in the bows of the freighter where it was joined to the mother ship by the fore connecting arm  A sense of bitter futility overwhelmed me  This or something like it was just the way a film about a disaster in space looks  These were moments no human eye would ever see again this was a great adventure that had failed   I couldnt see how we could get out of this  The loss of one freighter meant the end of the expedition  Captain Nortons voice broke into these terrible seconds giving orders for the course correction motor to run at its lowest force in the same direction as the rotating movement  We saw the centrifugal motion of the third freighters stern stop and then change to moving the opposite way  The stem was beginning to approach the mother ships hull again and we were afraid the connecting arm might not hold  It bent but it held  Another bum of the course correction motor brought the freighter her stem now secured to the mother ship by cables to a standstill  No movement at all  The star-shaped structure of the convoy was drifting like a rudderless ship on a lonely sea  The following few hours meant intensive work for the whole crew  Williams Lawrenson and Trott in their heavy duty spacesuits welded the end of the connecting arm back into place with oxygen burners  Gray and Briggs repaired the hole in the freighters bows it was almost five metres long  The ships pressure and insulation systems were damaged  Watts and I were busy seeing to the two engineers from the freighter  At the moment when air escaped from the cabin through the huge rent in the ships hull the pressure inside sank to zero within a second before the low-pressure safety valve could close the visors of their helmets and that tiny fraction of the time that stretched out all around us out into eternity was enough to make both men lose consciousness  Sheldon was bleeding from both ears  Radcliff was suffering from vertigo every time he moved his head however slightly he vomited  This accident cost every member of the crew some forty-eight hours hard work and nervous tension but that was not the end of it       Two days later the condition of both engineers was fair  But I got some very bad news from Jenkins the captain had relieved Chief Engineer Glennon of his post accusing him of negligence in the conduct of the rescue operation and of endangering the lives of all members of the expedition  The captain felt that Glennon should have known that the incorrect use of the freighter engine at Force Two would have catastrophic results and he would not hear a word of defence  OBrien who had been in the main control room during the operation too said something about an unavoidable risk in exceptional circumstancesso Jenkins told mewhereupon the captain was so angry that he sent OBrien out of the cabin  I took a very dim view indeed of the whole incident  OBrien had made a bad mistake by reminding the captain just then of the time when we nearly lost a man overboard and the captains reaction was even more ill-judged he had insulted OBriens personal dignity  I felt that things were really beginning to get complicated  We waited for the figures to come up from Mission Control with secret misgivings  It was obvious that an accident halfway through the flight course correction must have resulted in a further deviation from course  But how great would it be What possibility did we have of making another course correction At a distance of millions of kilometres how far could we rely on the precision of movement that was to make our course intersect the orbit of Mars in a given number of days At last Mission Control came through  The computer centre spat out a long row of figures  Once again we fired the correction motors the stars shot past the portholes and the shadows on the ships surface fluctuated wildly  We could only trust that all was well  When our usual daily radio contact with Earth was over Jenkins announced a special message for the whole crew and we heard the captains voice  He was brief and to the point  He told us that he was making a personal apology to his deputy for his thoughtlessness and he hoped that so unfortunate an incident at a critical moment would make no difference to the friendship mutual respect and good understanding between us all  At the same time he was confirming his decision about Chief Engineer Glennon  He made this declaration in his ordinary voice but it alarmed meI could imagine what an effort the apology cost him  A lot now depended on the way OBrien would react  A few days later I could see that it was all cleared up  OBrien and the captain were talking to each other just as they used to in the carefree days of our cosmo-nautical training  A psychiatrist gets all sorts of complexes I told myselfa kind of occupational hazard  I tried to reassure myself but I couldnt help trying to find out more  Next time I was alone with OBrien I asked him You dont mind if I mention it do you Its just scientific interestbut I would like to know if you and Captain Norton have cleared the whole thing up now OBrien looked at me with his abstracted smile  Oh well Cosby he said you know I tend to judge other people by my own standards  I cant think that that decision about Glennon was right I really cant  Still thats just my own opinionno reflection on the captains authority  No youve got me wrong OBrien I said  I wasnt talking about Glennon  Oh I see he said still smiling  You mean the way he put me down Well we all know theres still a lot of the savage left in usall it takes is a rush of blood to the brain and there we are fighting for the best place by the fire in the cave Every man of us But with your medical experience you must know more about that than I do  However to set your mind at rest I assure you I know the scoreIm a biologist I know about the importance of the environment and I do feel convinced that we must all contribute to the success of the expedition down to the last drop of our blood  The only man with no psychological problems at all was Wellgarth the astrophysicist  When he wasnt asleep in his cabin he was bound to be in the observatory recording spectrum analyses making calculations with the aid of charts writing writing writing  He was so deep in his subject that he had no time to think of anything else at all  He could easily get a tube of washing-paste mixed up with a tube of condensed milk  He often had faults in his equipmentsomething which really upset the tidy-minded captain  Wellgarth was sharply reprimanded for his shortcomings things that were merely comic now might mean life or death in different circumstances  As I mentioned earlier we could live in the sleeping-cabins the gangways and the clubroom without our spacesuits wearing nothing but lightweight close-fitting overalls  One evening Wellgarth came in to supper with part of his absorbent woollen underwear hanging out behind him  He floated majestically into the room the inevitable notebook in his hand and this peculiar white tail waving out behind  As McKinley said later he looked just like a cherub with its wings in the wrong place  His absence of mind was hard to understand it was something no one had noticed during our training  The longer we lived together in our cramped shipboard quarters the worse became our feeling of being cut off from everything wed known on Earth  The individual quirks of our characters became more marked which was often surprising and sometimes depressing  It was as if there were really remnants of our primitive natures hidden in the secret convolutions of the brainqualities left over from the time when every man gnawed his marrow bone by the fire in his own cave moving instinctively to protect his own throat  Of course these were just momentary flashes reflexes mastered at once by the bridle of moral restraints yet a practised eye could distinguish them quite clearly  I was often so bothered by such thoughts that I couldnt sleep and I would lie awake thinking that if this spaceflight was to serve as nothing but the fulfilment of the dreams of a few technologists back on Earth it was meaningless  What does the man in the street care about Mars Mars has been there ever since mankind came into beingan insignificant spark in the night sky  What does a man care about the heroic conquest of desolate uninhabited planets when he has to worry how to pay for the few square metres of his own house how to feed himself and his children If our voyage was to have any meaning we must find it in the battle we were now fighting in the depths of our own inner cosmos  That was where the boundaries we must extend lay  CHAPTER 5 Early on in our voyage we had often imagined the solemn moment when half our interplanetary flight would be behind us and at last out of the endless succession of days that day came up  In the space for the date on the ships clock of course it was only a number evoking no sense of festivity just reminding us how many more numbers still lay hidden in the mechanism of that clock  In the Club that evening we were edgy rather than in a mood to celebrate  The captain made a short speech more like an official report than an invitation to make merry  There was no clinking of glasses as we drank a toast we sucked up fruit juice through straws from plastic sachets and no one felt like talking except for Gray deep in argument with Briggs about the merits of battery-powered cars  We didnt like each other muchin fact we could hardly stand each other  This was nothing new of course these were symptoms familiar from Antarctic expeditions  Yet what puzzled me was the realisation that none of these negative symptoms had ever shown up during our long and arduous training  Most of all I feared the days still ahead  I wasnt so much afraid of catastrophe caused by some technological failure as of the gradual disintegration of our morale  I felt sorry our sense of comradeship was disappearing yet I realised that I wasnt doing anything to keep it going myself  I was just too tired to think  My mind was ticking over all right making correct judgments but my will power had given out  Again and again I tried to bury myself in my work to escape the stress of my environment but every single day looking at my records of the mens medical check-ups Id find that what I wanted to escape was staring me in the face  Morphy had gastric trouble gastric neurosis more like  I knew why  Silcott Glennon and Jenkins were suffering from insomnia  I knew why  During our training Glennon used to snore his head off at nights  Sometimes I even regretted not having gone in for a different branch of scienceastronomy mathematics cosmology  Id be in my element now like a fish in water  But then I had second thoughts the unknown worlds which I was exploring were all around me too within myself and my companions  They rose from the unplumbed depths of the psychic cosmos  Then Id feel happier again  All of us were making efforts to escape the punishing monotony of our days  Sometimes they took strange forms  Once when I was asleep Radcliff woke me up asking me to go and see McKinley he said there was something wrong with him and muttered something about just a joke  I couldnt make out what he was getting at  When I went into the cabin where McKinley slept I found Thompson there too comforting McKinley who had tears streaming from his eyes  I discovered that Radcliff and Thompson had cooked up a practical joke with unexpected consequences  The sleeping-cabins in the middle of the ship natu- rally had no portholes there was just a dim blue light for orientation  Before they went to bed Radcliff and Thompson came for a word with McKinley and by previous arrangement with each other surreptitiously put out the blue light so that the cabin was pitch dark  They just went on talking and when McKinley asked what had happened to the light they pretended it was still on as usual  It was an old gag and a drastic one and it ended unexpectedly  McKinley panicked thinking hed gone blind and fell into a fit of hysterical weeping  McKinley the born clown of all people I had to put him under strong sedation  The incident convinced me more than ever that our human capabilities and reactions now needed to be measured on a different cosmic scale  Over the next few days I had private talks with the men about the danger of jokes of this kind and I also asked them not to give each other silly nicknames  I wasnt sure that they all appreciated how serious the problem really was  The captain and OBrien decided to hold daily conferences about our plans for the scientific exploration of the Martian surface to raise the crews lowered morale  Really this was going over ground we had already covered wed been all through these plans very thoroughly before back on Earth  But another look at them in a different environment brought some life back into the flagging organism of the expedition  The idea that the moment when those plans would actually be put into practice was coming steadily closer stimulated us  I observed that the mood of the crew as a whole went in cycles like the alternation of night and day winter and summer  I was still bothered by the Glennon affair  I knew the chief engineer as an intelligent energetic character able to take a general view beyond the confines of his own field  He knew quite a lot about music and painting which isnt always the case with technologists  His present mental state worried me  He showed no inter- est in anything just did exactly as he was told  His personal pride kept him from defending himself in any way he had made a mistake he was ready to pay for itbut I was sure the price was too high  I got together with OBrien whose feelings on the matter I knew and we decided to try putting it to the captain in a different light  The interview went something like this  The captain invited us into his cabin but Id hardly mentioned Glennons name when he interrupted me  Yes I know how he feels he said  I think highly of Glennon as a man and as an engineer  But hes made one mistake and I cantin fact I mustntbelieve that he wont make another  Ive told him that my decision implies no criticism of his expertise but I just cant allow some momentary indispositionsay someone swallowing his food too fastto endanger the whole expedition  Im not reversing my decisionnot unless I get orders from Mission Control  This was like throwing down the gauntlet  He must know perfectly well that Mission Control would never question his authority by reversing a decision he as commander of the ship had made  And naturally it was out of the question for us to tell Mission Control about our difference of opinion thus complicating a situation which was complicated enough already  OBrien saw that at once  Why so aggressive Captain he said  Were not trying to undermine your authority you know I mean were not a mutinous delegation or something  Come now Dr Cosby has the right to give you his opinion  I realised it had been a tactical error to take OBrien with me when I approached the captain  Id be glad if youd consider this conversation private Captain I said  Im not concerned about Glennon as chief engineerits his mental state that worries me  Well what dyou expect me to do asked the captain  He still sounded aggressive  Apologise In the interests of a piece of false sentimentality which might eventually cost us all our lives No Im sorry Ive just lost faith You lost that long ago Nortonthat is if you ever had any said OBrien  Your trouble is you wont believe in anyone but yourself  Lets drop the subject shall we OBrien Philosophy just doesnt mix with the command of an interplanetary spaceship  Yes thats where they made their mistake replied OBrien very much annoyed  Oh for heavens sake lets drop it I said  These are just passing difficulties surelyitll all be different out on Mars when the expedition really begins its work  All this will pass over  When I was alone with OBrien again he said Dont worry CosbyI think these are just passing problems too  But I didnt feel convinced that he really meant what he said  He was looking through the porthole in the gangway out at the depths of space where fiery messages scarcely visible flashed from distant worlds  Sticking it out winning through       thats what matters he said  You know once I had an odd idea  I thought the world the universe we perceive as endless space with countless solar systems and planets circling in its emptiness in well-defined orbits and ellipses is really nothing but a magnified picture of the microcosm  You see the apparently solid matter of a table leg but its really full of atoms protons neutrons all circling and eddying in the empty space of what we see as a mass  Maybe thats what were seeing through this porthole the empty space in the leg of some vast table with whole galaxies circling in it like atoms and above that table theres another great universe which is part of an even bigger universe and an even bigger table and so on Do you see what I mean I look at my own problems from that point of view  Yes I see what you mean all right I told him  Speaking as a doctor thoughhow does it help when you have toothache Oh it does helpyoud be surprised he said smiling  The view through the portholes into that dead black wilderness was so oppressive that it kept making me feel as though we were standing completely still a convoy of spaceships stuck fast in space and time  Nothing moved except the mechanism of the ships clock pushing numbers on without any apparent significance  One could fight back with the aid of reason but every such act of self-defence called for a certain amount of willpower  The worse the attack the stronger the defence had to beand the stronger the will-power  I noted a distinct lack of will-power in all members of the expedition expressing itself in indecision  I believed that even our energetic captain hadnt escaped the demoralising influence of his surroundings  However he reacted in his own way as if he were ashamed of any symptoms of weakness  He began to withdraw from our companionable friendly gatheringsnot that hed ever had much time for them anyway  He stopped coming to the Club  As ever Captain Norton came for his check-up on the dot  I was now making medical examinations only once a week  Well how does it look he asked when Id finished  He recognised the necessity for these check-ups but he had never before shown any interest in the result so far as he himself was concerned  Oh reasonable I replied  He looked hard at me for a moment  I felt he was hesitating to go on but finally he said That means not too good Im not worried about myself you understand       I interrupted him  I dont think I quite follow you Captain  I knew that he liked nothing better than exactitude so I brought out my tables of comparison and showed him the figures worked out after much research on Earth  As the captain knew nothing about my field it was not hard to convince him that his condition deviated only very slightly from the norm as set out in the tables-Im a believer in lies of expediency at such moments  I sometimes feel as thoughas though my brains not working properly the captain said  Ive been doing some mathematical tests just for my own satisfaction  I did three and one came out wrong  Thats not too good is it One coming out wrong is all right  It wouldnt be too good if all three came out wrong I said  Doctor I know youre trying to reassure me but I dont want help of that sort  It looks like charity  I suddenly decided to use this moment to make a direct attack and take the risk of ruining everything  Very well then Ill tell you what I think I said  You made one mistakeall right so that was bad  Glennon made one mistake and that was bad too  Just what I was going to say myself the captain said straight out  I felt enormously relieved  Captain I think more of what youve just said than of all these idiot tests thought up by some pen-pusher down in Mission Control I said  Theres nothing wrong with you at all Your mind is functioning brilliantly That same day there was an announcement over the communications system that Glennon was taking over as chief engineer again  The captain gave as his reason the fact that Glennon had acted under the pressure of exceptional circumstances and in evaluating the cause of the accident we couldnt rule out the possibility of some hidden material malfunction  Yet the result of the captains decision was quite different from what Id expected  Chief Engineer Glennon had indeed risen from the dead in the truest sense of the word but I found out that the other men were discussing the reasons for the captains action a lot  Nothing slanderousit was just that they were talking about the relationship between Captain Norton and OBrien  Everyone knew that the captain was never a man to compromise and so there were rumours that OBrien by some mysterious means had forced him to do so on this occasion  Theres nothing more damaging than secretiveness in a community like ours  A few days later Watts told me what Morphy had told him  There was a rumour spreading among the men that OBrien knew something which had to be kept secret from the crew and it was probably about our course and the corrections we had made  I was horrified  Watts and I discussed what precautions we ought to take against this sickness  Time was not on our side the appalling suspicion had infected the expedition like leprosy  We decided to consult OBrien before we went to the captain  I went to see OBrien on my own  He didnt seem very surprised and I felt that he did not really see how serious the situation was  You see the organisation of any living body is governed by laws it cant assess itself said OBrien  Laws which are quite beyond our will and our power  Though pure science will admit as much only on occasion and philosophys not quite sure of itself here  I lost my temper  Oh for Gods sake OBriento hell with your views I shouted  You sound like a preacher Cant you see the grounds breaking up under our feet OBrien stared at me in surprise  Whats the matter Doc Youve always been so reasonable and well-balanced Youre not yourself at all Cant you see you oughtnt to come bothering me with all this Rebellion just isnt my line  Thats what soldiers are for  I went away feeling bitter  OBrien had let me down for the first time  It seemed to me that Id found a weak spot in his character  It was only later much later in far more momentous circumstances that the deeper reaches of his thought and the real meaning of his conduct came home to me  The sickness did spread very rapidly  Within a few hours everyone was infected  When I went to see the captain in his cabin I tried to indicate that Id rather not talk to him in front of Jenkins who was on duty at the radio system  Go on DoctorJenkins knows were off course too Were never going to make it to Marscorrect Jenkins Jenkins gave a forced smile  All I know is thats what theyre saying Captain he said  I said nothing  The captain looked sharply at me  Well what do you think of my decision now he asked  A psychological error Ive got a different opinion myselfits the fruit of compromising and a pretty sour fruit too  CHAPTER 6 Time passed by desperately slowly and the two-hundredth day of our voyage approached  The men began to visit the observatory more often  Mars was showing up clearer and more brightly in the telescope though to the naked eye it was still a shining reddish spot on a black velvet background  I must say that Ive never been particularly convinced of the all-conquering power of drugs  If a man cant do something by his own efforts if the body cant help itself chemistry will do it only with great difficulty  I had very little faith indeed left in our white pink and blue pills after nearly two hundred days of spaceflight  We were not in bad shape physically apart from some weight loss slight changes in blood pressure and occasional disturbances in our organs of balance  Our long-term weightlessness had been relatively well compensated for  But mentallyand this is where I felt responsiblewe were all hard hit  Both the engineers who had suffered from shock owing to the sudden drop in pressure when the third freighter had its accident were doing quite well though Radcliff often complained of headaches and attacks of vertigo  By an irony of fate my first really serious case was my colleague Dr Watts  He had carelessly pricked himself with the hypodermic needle as he was taking blood tests  We observed the rules of antisepsis strictly but after a few hours the insignificant little prick became inflamed and though Watts cut out the affected spot at once and treated the place thoroughly he soon had a high temperature  His hand swelled enormously right up to the elbow and so did the lymphatic vessels in his armpit and throat  I did all I could but it looked as if there would be no alternative to amputation of the hand  Watts who had come back to his senses after a period of delirium groaned as if he could read my thoughts  Give it another hourthen amputate he said  Id like to get out of this alive  Then he became delirious again  I was sweating from every pore I felt desperately anxious  Watts really had very little chance  Perhaps the organism degenerated in the sterile environment of the spaceship losing its natural powers of resistance However in an hours time his condition had improved  I dressed the reopened wound and that brought him some relief  Injections helped too  We were past the critical point  But Watts was so weak that he had to be artificially fed for six more days and though he recovered completely later he was always physically the weakest member of the expedition after that  I believe it was his invincible will to live that saved him  And so though incredibly slowly the end of our journey began to emerge more clearly from the dark shadows of our mental disturbances  Just two months stood between us and the end of our long flight  We knew all of us that only belief in the success of the expedition could put some backbone into us again  It may sound like the pathetic fallacy but there are moments when Man needs something great to believe in  Something greater than himself in whose beams he can bask  A need that began by prehistoric fires with the fight of the setting sun and was called the Great Unknown to be followed by the Great Spirit then the Great God later it might be called Great Love Great Longing Great Knowledge Great Energybut always something great  The alarm Grade Three sounded on all ships of the convoy  All crew members had to put on heavy duty spacesuits  The radar system had discovered an unidentified body of considerable mass in the path of our flight  Probably a large meteorite  We could not be sure at first from the evidence on the screen if it was one large one or a group of small fragments  It was a long way off but considering our speed and the speed of the body coming towards us the distance would decrease rapidly  Long moments of suspense followed  What a trick of fate to calculate our course and that of the unknown meteor so that this great dream of humanity could be utterly obliterated in a single flash in the fraction of a second There was an announcement from the control room  They had discovered the bodys direction of movement  In theory it should cross our course at an acute angle and we now knew that it was a swarm of large meteorites  Considering the immensity of space and the relatively insignificant size of the spaceship the chances of a collision were almost nil but there was still just the ghost of a chance to worry us  We knew that a meteorite swarm would have little offshoots such a cloud of meteorite fragments could be several dozen kilometres in diameter  And a single fragment the size of a cherry stone could penetrate the armoured hull of our ship with all the kinetic force of an atomic shell  We sat through two endless hours in our heavy spacesuits our fife support systems attached  The micrometeorite counter was working feverishly  I felt as if I were in a submarine with a deadly torpedo making towards it  Then the micro-meteorite count fell to normal and the radar signals died away  The control room told us the alert was over  Silcott who had been on duty at the radar instruments during the alert later calculated that the meteorite swarm flew past us about thirty kilometres away so close by cosmic standards that in Silcotts words it nearly scraped the skin off our back  McKinley claimed that the supposed meteorite swarm was really a flight of Martian ducks and said he was going to ask the captain to relieve Silcott of his post on the grounds of total incompetence  We could laugh again now For the next few days I had my hands full  We had a new sickness  Morphy in great excitement came and told me that hed been looking through a porthole when he saw shining yellow sparks flying round the convoy  Since Morphy was not the psychotic type and his check-ups had consistently shown that he was one of the most well-balanced members of the crew I was rather surprised  He could give no reasonable explanation of what hed seen and of course flying yellow sparks were just impossible  I asked him to come and tell me at once if they gave a repeat performance  The next day Williams Briggs and Trott saw flying sparks too  We seemed to be in the throes of another mental infection  McKinley roared with laughter at all three of them  What no white mice too he inquired  He came to see me himself the same day  My God Cosby Ive been seeing them myself Hed obviously been knocked backwards  Sparks flying about the place like glow-worms he said  Come and see for yourself I looked through the porthole but all I could see was the motionless sparkling of the stars  McKinley lost his temper  For Gods sake Im not a foollook over there Look on the third freighter now theyre swarming up over the stem theyre sinking slowly down       We had a kind of minor palace revolution  Some claimed it was a hallucination others believed in some unknown cosmic phenomenon the third group didnt know what to think  Once Id established the fact that no two men had ever seen sparks at the same time I thought a genuine phenomenon was ruled out and that put mass suggestion out of court as well  Soon after that Captain Norton saw the glowworms himself  They began flying inside the ship too mostly in darkened cabins  I was baffled  I puzzled over the cause of the phenomenon until my head was fairly buzzing  Then suddenly 1 saw them The glowworms appeared in a dark comer of my surgery  By then Id had enough I took a tranquilliser  Was the whole expedition abo it to go down with mass hallucinations Next day I concentrated my mind methodically on investigating the glow-worm mystery  Feeling sure that I must look for sone real solid cause I looked through the medical records  Then I had a sudden flash of inspiration and things connected up  Six days earlier as gradual preparation for conditions on Mars I had begun to decrease the amount of compensatory drugs I was prescribing for weightlessness  Which meant that the decreased concentration of that compensatory material in the bloodstream could be producing certain optical illusions  In a few days time my theory turned out to be correct  The glow-worm mystery was solved and McKinley proceeded to exp ain to one and all that counting out pills was all you could expect of a doctor with a total lack of poetic feeling  Again and again I hid been confirmed in my feeling that even the most careful most scientifically thorough training of astronauts cant preclude the appearance of new and unknown fzetors under the stress of reality  Watts and I were careful to keep records we felt sure they could be of great value for the future  Myself I found this conviction of mine very helpful in overcoming my own mental crises during the darkest days of our flight  I gradual y managed to attain a state of mental balance such as Wellgarth had preserved the whole time  Of course there was a fundamental difference unlike Wellgarth I had to occupy my mind with analysis of its own depression instead of with spectral analysisI couldnt escape to other worlds  I found that the Gray and Briggs affair relieved the stifling atmosphere of our communal life a bit  Ever since their quarrel which Id been able to settle relatively easily at the time they had been friends again  One day when I asked Briggs how they were getting on now he told me theyd thought up a new way of passing the time when they were on duty at the control systems on board the freighters which in normal circumstances didnt call for particularly close attention  They would compete with each other in inventing happenings on all sorts of subjects  Briggs said hed won a competition to think of the silliest thing possible  Youve no idea how hard it is to think of something downright silly he said half-seriously  Far easier to do something silly You need to use your brains I can tell youyou know Ive developed an enormous respect for people who write black humour  I think Ill try my own hand at writing when we get back  As you can see cosmic medicine has unsuspected possibilities       Glennon seemed to be more or less all right again too though he was more reserved than before but I saw that as a natural reaction to an accident which might have ended in disaster  Fearing he might develop an inferiority complex I sometimes tried to talk the whole thing over with him emphasising the fact that in extra-terrestrial conditions a mans mental machinery is far more easily disturbed than a real machine  I was rather surprised to find out something quite different was bothering him  He felt sure the strained relations between Captain Norton and OBrien were his fault  All I could do was probe further  What strained relations I asked  Oh good heavens Cosby we all know how they feel about each other  Well how do they feel about each other Glennon said nothing for a moment  Then he said Youre trying to worm things out of me Cosby  I know thats your jobbut you know yourself they cant stand each other Thats a risky thing to say I replied  Bloody dangerous too if you talk to the men like that  The fact is were all a little sick  The trouble is that its my fault I tried to convince him that he was blaming himself too much  Captain Norton and OBrien are utterly different types  All the same they could complement each other perfectly I added  Could said Glennon bitterly  Could if they would I dont think either of them wants to  The captains furious because he was made to compromise  I wouldnt like to be in the shoes of the next man he disciplines  I knew he was right  That was the worst of it  CHAPTER 7 Our visits to the observatory made us feel we were waking from a nightmare  There were moments when Mars shone red within the range of the telescope showing details familiar to us from photographic maps taken by equipment on the probesmaps which our imaginations had used on Earth to show us the exciting experiences aheadand at these stirring moments the impression of unreality entirely vanished from our voyage  Our sense of something special sublime and unique re-awoke  Life still had meaning  But only a few hours later we would fall into a dull lethargy again  I can hardly bear to talk about our feelings at the time theyre difficult for a normal person to understand  However we were not normal  Wed learnt to control our muscles in weightlessness but not our feelings  Every emotion experienced outside the pull of Earths gravity is over-intense quite insignificant impulses produce vibrations which have unexpected results  The results of millions of years evolution of human thought in terrestrial conditions cant be remodelled by a few years of training and a few grams of some chemical or other  Our radio contact with Mission Control was pretty good throughout the flight  It helped us feel that we still belonged to a world where trees grew rivers flowed and there were white clouds in the sky  Yet every time the red light began to blink in the mother ship our tension re-awoke what message would that coded row of figures contain This time the row of figures was unusually long  The captain and Silcott sat in front of the small computer and the navigational charts in the captains cabin for some time  Then there was another rather complicated course correction manoeuvre and once more the stars wheeled around us  Some days later Jenkins the radio engineer came to see me  He looked wretchedly ill and was complaining of exhaustion due to insomnia  He asked to be laid off duty  I took his blood pressure and tested his reflexes he really was at the end of his tether  He didnt answer most of my questions he looked as if he wasnt really there at all  Because I couldnt see any response at all to my efforts to help him and Id had just about enough myself I shouted at him and seized his shoulders quite roughly  As in most such cases his reaction was unexpected  Jenkins began to sob and cry convulsivelya humiliating thing to happen to the weeping man as well as anyone watching him  Jenkins was the youngest member of the expedition  I had to inject a sedative and at last when his convulsive spasms began to wear off he said Im completely through  Its no use  No use at all    And that was all he would say to the rest of my questions  With some difficulty I finally managed to get inside his mental world  He told me in disjointed sentences that Mission Control several days ago had told us we were deviating very seriously from our course  Jenkins was sure it would be impossible to correct the error and wed all fly past Mars and end up adrift in the deserts of space  Whatever I said I couldnt manage to get this obsession out of his head  He clung to it as the one sure and certain thing he knew like a shipwrecked sailor clinging to a floating log which is drifting with the current into a deadly whirlpool  The one promise I did manage to get from him was not to tell anyone else what hed said to me  I am almost sure Jenkins kept his promise but the rest of the crew couldnt help noticing his appearance  His face looked ten years older and of course there was no hiding the fact that he was not on duty in the main control room any more  Imaginations began to work and naturally they painted gloomy pictures of disaster in the darkest possible colours  The crew began to feel that the expeditions commanders were keeping something from them that that something was a deviation in our course which could not be corrected and that Jenkins knew about it hence his collapse  In this condition of near-insanity a self-appointed delegation of Sheldon and Trott went to the captain demanding the truth  The captain whose own nerves were on edge flung them straight out and then made a brief announcement over the communications system informing us that anyone who spread rumours of a deviation from our course would have his name put down for a reprimand when the expedition got back for unnecessarily endangering our safetyand he added that he had already put down Jenkinss name as an example to the rest  I was really at my wits end now  I was sure Jenkins wasnt to blame  What good were all my careful psychological calculations if the captain was determined to take drastic measures It was unthinkable that hed be amenable to psychoanalysis at the moment  What do all the brilliant achievements of technology amount to if men fall down over the basic task of living together Later I realised that I hadnt been objective enough at the time  For instance I blamed OBrien a lot for letting me down over Jenkins  I went to him furious about the captains decision but he set off on his rambling philosophical meditations again and all I could gather in the end was that he had no intention of interfering with the captains authority  I began to suspect that OBrien felt insulted by his subordinate position and was putting up a kind of passive resistance  Or maybe just taking refuge in the world of his own complicated thoughts  How little I knew him at the time in fact how badly I misjudged the whole thing In the midst of general hysteria OBrien was doing the most sensible thing possible keeping the oil tank well away from the fire  You havent a hope in hell of getting an experimental rabbit to flyyou must see that he told me  It just doesnt have wings  Right so consider us as experimental rabbits  Thats fair enough  It took us over two thousand million years to crawl up on land out of the water and breathe air  And now you want to change the laws of nature in a few days Life will soon be finished with usdo you honestly believe that everything Man has ever thought of as being great and unalterable ethical truth is really so great and unalterable as all that Its all relative  Or do you think that nature in sparing no efforts to evolve man out of the reptiles had some kind of Justice with a capital J in mind One day during this gloomy period the captain asked us to attend a discussion group in the Club  Everyone not on duty at the time was to be there and the others were kept in radio contact  The captain opened the meeting by saying briefly that the expedition was teetering on the edge of disasternot because of any error in the calculation of our course but because of the crews mental and physical condition  At present we were in a state which both endangered the success of the exacting landing manoeuvre and meant that there was grave doubt whether in our present frame of mind we could manage to erect a base camp and survive on Mars for four hundred and forty days  There was just one way out of this situation and he could put it in a single word Trust No one said a word and I thought how desperately primitive an attempt this was at raising our morale when over two hundred days had eaten it away  I stared straight ahead at nothing  Then OBrien stood up  I pulled myself together enough to wonder what he was going to say  OBrien said just two words Yes trust At first I took this for a poorly timed joke or the prelude to some ironic comment but nothing of the kind followed  No one else wanted to speak and the meeting was over  I didnt have too low an opinion of my own psychiatric experience and yet this primitive appeal of the captains backed up by OBrien with just two words showed me how little we really know about the workings of the human mind  After that curious discussion group which discussed nothing the atmosphere began to clear  Not naturally as if wed had some kind of religious enlightenment  The miasma just dispersed like smoke over a battlefield there was a lingering smell of fire but we could feel a fresh breeze blowing  What had actually happened What had changed Could a single word work like a magic spell Well not the word exactly but the idea       after all it was a great thing to recognise that only trust could keep us going  Now time began to speed up too  Mars was blazing in the sky like a great red star  Forty more days  Suddenly that sounded surprisingly little  We began to believe that down therethis was how we had come to speak of landing on Marseverything would be all right again  Gradually the conviction that we had the worst behind us grew stronger  Naturally all our troubles did not vanish overnight  Some of the worst affected members of the expedition kept falling back into a state of dull apathy for no apparent reason  Jenkins was the worst he was suffering from a strong sense of grievance  I made up my mind to talk to the captain about him  Captain Norton listened carefully and coolly and then told me that while he respected my medical opinion he saw no possibility of a solutionand obviously to dispel any illusions I might still have he informed me that there was no question at all of his reversing this decision  He was convinced that Jenkins was partly to blame for the poor state of the mens morale and after his experience of a compromise over Glennon his decision was irreversible  When I objected speaking as a psychiatrist he replied Dr Cosby surely you can see that this expeditions not a school outing This is a team of grown men  We always knew that was a basic condition for the expeditions success just as soon as we began to plan it  Look at it this waywere the shock troops of science and progress and we must have strictdont shrink from the wordstrict military discipline  No one ever got anywhere without it  Oh I can see we have to have discipline I said  But myself I dont like to see men knocking at the gates of space with the butts of their guns  All right I know youve got it in for the Army said the captain  There was emptiness behind his smile  Youve had trouble with the Army over a whole string of projects havent you You neednt think Im in the Army because I like war and bloodshed thats all  I believe in law and orderthats the way I see things  We had quite a long argument it helped me understand the captain better but I was primarily concerned about Jenkins  Finally the captain said Cosby I dont underestimate your function in this expedition not in any way  Im not the sort of fool who imagines hes in command of a troop of robots  I really would like to help you over Jenkins  But not by compromising Now this is what I suggest  We go over the whole thing again in public  Im still putting his name down for reprimand of course I cant withdraw that  But Im ready to add a rider that after we return to Earth Ill give up any say in the matter myself in the interests of getting the case objectively settled  You cant ask me to do any more than that We went back over the Jenkins affair the same day the proceedings lasted a bare half-hour and after the captains summing up we all parted in silence  I thought the captains gesture had made a deep impression indeed I felt it was something more than a mere gesture  CHAPTER 8 We had another meteorite alarm no doubt to keep us from getting any impression that our spaceship was turning into a peaceful convalescent home  The radar systems found several large meteorite swarms in the depths below us  They could be small stones or whole chunks of rock trapped in the gravitational pull of Mars the wandering remnants of some former planet that once moved between Mars and Jupiter  Did we have a new attack of dark mysterious powers to face According to the radar instruments the meteorites were a safe distance away and not moving to intersect our course  With the disappearance of the light flecks from the radar screen tension gradually subsided so it was an even worse shock to get an emergency signal from the first freighter  They had a malfunction of the airlock  Gray reported a sudden drop in pressure and rapid loss of air  Briggs was unconscious  Soon the rescue team in heavy duty spacesuits were floating around the bows of the first freighter and back came an explanation of the accident  There was a small hole punched by a meteorite in the armour plating of the ships hull right outside the cabin  Silcott said the metal around the hole had melted completely  Describing the incident later all Gray could tell us was that he thought he heard a shot somewhere inside the ship and directly afterwards he felt a rush of blood to the head  At that moment the visor of his helmet automatically closed  He turned to find Briggs who had been having a drink at the moment of the explosion and at once noticed the unnatural position of his body  When he bent down to see his friends face he realised that Briggs was unconscious and the broken end of one of the straws we used for drinking was hanging out of his helmet at the spot where the transparent visor closed  Of course it had shut automatically when the pressure dropped but the straw was trapped which meant that the helmet was not hermetically sealed  So now we had another patient  Luckily it turned out that the accident had had no serious consequences  Briggs seemed all right again in a few hours time and he had no further trouble apart from a good deal of earache  We discussed this incident a lot  In the opinion of Compton the planetologist the actual meteorite which went through the freighters side could not have been more than a millimetre in diameter yet its kinetic force on impact with the counter-movement of the ship had caused an explosion sufficient to pierce the armour plating of the hull  It was disturbing to think that we were moving through a belt which might contain several more alarming missiles of this kind and we now knew that there were no fantastic odds against the meeting of two bodies in the vast expanses of space the readings of the meteorite counter and the scratches on the ships hull bore witness to that  We felt like sailors steering their way through a minefield  Looking back at our experiences up to this point I feel that all our problems may have been an invaluable preparation for our long stay on Mars itself  Just as the planet Earth had gradually receded from our field of vision at the start of the journey so the planet Mars now loomed before us growing gradually larger  It was a fascinating sighta blazing red light in the dead wastes of interplanetary space  We already longed for the moment when we would stand on its surface  Twenty-five more days Impatience and the urge for activity dispelled all our psychoses we were responding to the idea of the fantastic unique moment that lay ahead  I noticed that we were adopting a kind of formality even in the way we walked and I often wondered if our recent troubles had been real at all or if we had just been exaggerating small details blowing them up to monstrous size suffering wild distortion of our feelings as the result of some unknown space fever  Twenty more days  The slight course corrections we had to make no longer worried anyone  Mars shone there ahead motionless like a blazing signal  The whole crew was busy preparing for the most difficult stage of the whole flight  The trust between us worked wonders all weak ourselves as individuals we were now welded together into a single effective organism  Of course there was still a lot to be desired in the way of complete physical fitness  Our health had suffered and we were that much older  We had stomach upsets headaches sudden attacks of faintness accompanied by unusually heavy outbreaks of sweat and unpleasant rashes  To be honest we didnt look much like film heroes conquering space  We could tell how fast the spaceship was racing on by the rapid fall in the numbers recording our distance from Mars  A single unit denoted a million kilometres  The shining dot became a round reddish bead its size growing hourly  The sight moved us profoundly after the endless hours when nothing at all was going on in space around us  We were in constant communication with Mission Control now  Our distance from Mars was less than a million kilometres  The planet began to look as large as the Moon as seen from Earth  It hung in the dark sky like a globe of red-hot iron cooling down  If we were to fly straight on we could land on its surface in only twenty-four hours but now we had to change course to put ourselves into orbit  There was really nothing we could do but trust to technology  The hours flew past  We were approaching the moment of our first braking manoeuvre  Two hundred thousand kilometres from Mars strapped tight into our anti-gravitation seats we felt a crushing sensation as the braking motors were fired  The whole complicated manoeuvre was entrusted to the steel brain of the main computer our human brains overloaded by increased blood pressure were not working adequately  I dont really know how to express our feelingsput into words they seem lifeless just so much paper  Ive often thought that there are some moments and experiences which are genuinely beyond description  Words are merely our impressions of the real thing like pressed flowers in the scrapbook of memory  When the green light began to blink and I unfastened my belt to see the huge shining globe of Mars outside the porthole for the first time a strange emotion constricted my throat  It was impossible not to be overcome by the monumental grandeur of that moment  CHAPTER 9 From now on we began to reckon by Mars Time  I forced myself to calm down  We were orbiting the planet at a distance of about a hundred and fifty thousand kilometres roughly in the plane of its equator  On the daytime side we could see the dark patches of the so-called seas and the ochre grey red and russet des- ert plains of the mainland  The polar region was tinged with pink  As we orbited the planet we saw its phases change gradually from full to crescent until the whole globe disappeared from sight in the impenetrable darkness of the universe  Only a black space where no stars shone showed us its position  The expeditions first scientific mission was to take detailed pictures of the satellite Deimos which orbits Mars at a distance of 23900 kilometres  The planet hung there in space looking like a vast cleverly constructed globe but this was no model on a lecture-room tableI had to force myself to believe it  A brief burn from the braking jets corrected our course  The computers in the captains cabin crackled and spat out a row of figures  Now we were in a different orbit  Our radar systems tried to get a fix on the Martian satellite and finally it appeared on the screen  But there had been a slight miscalculation and small as it was it meant that the orbit of Deimos would not intersect ours  All we saw of the satellite a great lump of rock eight kilometres in diameter and now lit up by the sun was a small flying bluish star  Another course correction would mean a tricky manoeuvre and a considerable wastage of fuel so we had to write off our first scientific venture  It was not particularly serious the job was listed as of secondary importance to the project  We had to concentrate mainly on fulfilling the basic condition for our success a landing on Phobos the other satellite of Mars  Pho-bos was to be our jumping-off point and it was absolutely indispensable for our landing on Mars as well as our return to Earth  The thrust of the braking motors pressed us back into our seats  The countdown telling us our height above the surface of Mars fell from twenty-three thousand to nine thousand five hundred  The least mistake now would be literally fatal  We had no time to spare for the fantastic view through the portholes  Our lives hung on a few seconds and a few strands of metal  Ac- cording to our calculations our orbit now coincided with the orbit of Phobos which gave us a moments breathing-space  As we hung in space apparently motionless and the huge globe of the planet turned slowly menacingly close to us our radar systems probed space for Phobos  The engines corrected our orbiting speed  By our reckoning the Martian satellite should come somewhere near our convoy in just under three hours time  We watched the great three-dimensional map of Mars through the portholes  It was reminiscent of a copper relief map of the Moon covered with layers of ancient dust  Since the speed of our movement was much greater than that of the planets rotation we could watch the shift of light and dark as our first Martian night came on enveloping us too after an hour and a half for the first time in many days we saw the sun disappear behind the dark body of Mars rimming the planets edge with an arc of burning red at the spot where it sank  A bright speck appeared on the radar screen  Phobos was approaching  We adjusted orbiting speed again to synchronise with the speed of the satellite  We could not carry out a landing on Phobos in the dark of the Martian night we had to fly on for another three and a quarter hoursthree and a quarter hours of darkness and suspense  At last the thin atmosphere of Mars slowly lightened we saw the bright reddish curve of the planet again and soon afterwards the light of the rising sun blazed out  Then quite close to our convoy we could see a vast cosmic rock standing out against the velvety black of the star-strewn skythe satellite Phobos  We gazed at the bright crescent of Mars arching across our whole field of vision like some titanic red sandstone bridge  None of us uttered a word we were all having to cope with the shattering sublimity of that sight on our own  Im not sure how long the moment lasted I lost all sense of time  A sharp crackling sound like static brought time back into being for us and we heard the captains voice over the loudspeaker  It was strangely subdued almost irresolute but it brought us back to reality  The landing on Phobos was essential for our later landing on Mars Phobos was to act as a space station  When we had detached a considerable part of the mother ship the reserve fuel tanks and one of the freighters it would serve as an ideal way station and supply post  After a given number of days to be spent on the surface of Mars we were to fly home in the command module of the mother ship leaving behind the rest of our ironmongery which meant we could make a large saving on the amount of fuel we should otherwise have needed on our parabolic course back  Now we began the complicated manoeuvre of getting the two bodies to rendezvous in space  Phobos was coming slowly closer its dimensions increasing alarmingly  On a planetary scale maybe it was the size of a pea but we were seeing it by Earth standards as a great mass of rock twice the size of Mount Everest  The closer it came the smaller our own spacecraft seemed  The radio locators measured the distance  Five kilometres  Seeing it with no atmosphere between us we felt we were almost touching the rock which was pitted by meteorites  I felt a slow barely perceptible sense of movement which reminded me of the way I always felt on a big ocean-going liner as it came into harbour gradually approaching the mole  Another thousand metres  The instruments showed a slight gravitational pull we had to compensate for it  The starshaped convoy slowly turned so that the freighters landing claws were at right angles to the surface of the satellite  The concepts of above and below began to mean something  A hundred metres still separated us from a shallow rocky hollow in the ground which looked like the remains of a small lunar crater  The surface of Phobos lit by the sun shone with a muted velvety glow  According to the instruments we were still twenty-five metres away from touchdown and our movement was snail-like but the lack of atmosphere gives such a deceptive impression of distance that I expected to feel the shock of impact any moment  Once again I was reminded of an ocean-going liner approaching harbour very slowly when a tiny error can keep the propeller and thus the ship moving too fast and this slight extra movement can bring the ships hull up against the mole and crush its strong plating like straw  Of course we were in a weightless environment but the inertia of the ship meeting with another solid body could set off all the sleeping tons of our vessel in an appalling explosion  Endless moments passed as we felt the blood beating in our templesand then at last came the almost imperceptible impact more like a quiver of the nervous system of machinery and men  A sense of enormous relief flooded our minds and bodies  The captains voice broke into this moment of wonderful calm giving orders to send back news of our successful landing on Phobos to Mission Control  His voice sounded oddly subdued and unmilitary  We gathered in the clubroom  I can hardly begin to describe the way we acted We were hugging each other and laughinga psychologist might have said we were in a state of hysteria but not if hed been through such an experience himself  We felt as if all prejudices obstacles and inhibitions were goneat that timeless moment we were aware of nothing but being there together in the harmony of the universe  CHAPTER 10 Almost all members of the expedition were now busy with the work of separating part of the mother ship  Since Phobos orbited the planet Mars once every seven hours thirty-nine minutes we had to divide working and resting shifts into roughly three-hour cycles  Half of Phoboss orbit lay in the shadow of the planet Mars and during this time the satellite was completely dark  We could not afford to waste electricity  As Phobos also rotated on its own axis we would find ourselves on the night-time side of the satellite at regular intervals even if we were in orbit over the sunlit half of the globe of Mars  However Phoboss night was so well lit by the gigantic mirror of the daytime half of Mars that visibility was almost as good as in the normal day  Since those members of the geological group who had any engineering training were working on the ship Compton and I were temporarily assigned to McKinley to help explore the surface of Phobos  The moment when we left the airlock in our spacesuits and trod on ground where no human foot had ever trodden before was unforgettable  The gravitational pull of the satellite itself was so slight that we had to use safety ropes it was difficult to keep in contact with the surface at all  The least muscular movement carried us several metres  Dust and pieces of rock raised from the surface by the merest touch floated around our feet  I felt as if I were moving in some improbable dream world  The horizon of this world ended as it were a few metres ahead in an abyss with stars sparkling in its depths  Our two-way radio equipment was working perfectly but just now we hardly needed it for even the experienced McKinley was left speechless  There was too much to see and feel  The pitted ground was very uneven furrowed by weathered craters and hollows  We came to a large rise which looked like a gigantic piece of slag and differed strikingly from its surroundings in colour  McKinley broke off a piece and put it in his collecting bag  Then he took several more samples and decided to drill a small shaft  We put the portable drill together and began to work  The bit pierced the rock as if it were soft earth  We bored down to two metres as far as the por- table drill would go but even at that depth the rock was soft  McKinley numbered all his samples and put them carefully in the bag  We drilled our second shaft in a hollow which looked as if the stone had once been molten  However the samples we took here looked the same as the first lot  McKinley numbered and kept them too  All this time we were on the sunny side of Phobos out of sight of the planet Mars  As we were drilling our third shaft the rotation of the satellite lengthened our shadows  We watched the sun go down below the horizon of Phobos and the huge sunlit globe of Mars begin to rise above the opposite horizon at the same time  It was such a fascinating sight that we stopped work to watch this amazing natural phenomenon in silence  Before long the whole horizon was filled by a three-dimensional view of the shining curved vault of the Martian surface rising higher and higher until it filled the entire sky like a fantastic curtain painted in glowing shades of ochre brown burnt sienna greenish and bluish grey down to pale mother-of-pearl against the dark violet velvety background of the shadows       When we had finished collecting our rock samples we went back to the mother ship we had never been out of sight of it  We felt quite intoxicated  It was the first time in my life Id ever felt almost drunk with beauty  Most of the others had had precious little time to indulge in looking at their strange surroundings  Three hours work in spacesuits was so exhausting that even the subsequent three hours rest in a cabin was not enough and the changed rhythm of our work was beginning to affect performance badly  Once the first excitement faded our accumulated weariness took its toll and we were also feeling the effect of the reduced dosage of compensatory drugs in the bloodstream  We had had to reduce them in preparation for the change from weightlessness back to normal conditionsso far as you can call conditions on Mars normal  We found that everything seemed to fluctuate wildly under interplanetary flight conditions we would swing between extreme excitement and dull lethargy  I still found this surprising I knew from our training period that we were all supposed to be exceptionally well-balanced individuals  After consulting me the captain decided to adapt the shifts of work to a new cycle ten hours rest followed by three hours intensive work and then another ten hours rest  Since the time we spent orbiting Mars could really be counted in with the time to be spent on Marsand there was quite a lot of that comingwe thought this was a justifiable arrangement  We worked out the new shift system to suit the orbit of Phobos put simply it meant that the rest period lasted for one flight through light and two through dark and the work period for one flight through light  As a result we felt less tired and we worked better but the job of separating parts of the convoy was slowed down and though we might seem to have a surplus of time we had to stick to our precisely worked-out schedule  The captain was beginning to get impatient  Wed already spent five days on the satellite Phobosor more precisely five times twenty-four hours thirty-seven min-utes and twenty-two secondsand still we were only half way through the work  We had a lot of difficulty unloading the big supply container meant for the mother ships voyage back from the fifth freighter  Williams told the captain that in the accident which had threatened the freighter on the way the structure connecting the container to the ship had been bent and we couldnt loosen the screws  The whole damaged part had to be cut away with oxygen burners  The captain handed over the direction of this part of the work to Chief Engineer Glennon in a tone of voice which plainly said whose fault he thought it waswhich struck me as an unnecessary exhibition of rancour after wed all been to so much trouble to smooth things over  And after that Glennon became rather bitter again which was not good for his fellow workers morale  We soon finished our geological research on Phobos the composition of the satellite was so uniform that there was really no point in extending the programme  McKinley and Compton confined themselves to taking a number of detailed photographs  But the meteorologist Morphy whose special field was the Martian atmosphere was practically in a condition of trance all the time that fantastic three-dimensional map of Mars was shining in our sky  He took an endless series of pictures to record various atmospheric phenomenaas he said himself it was something of a scientific orgy and when he told me about his work back in the cabin he struck me as the happiest man alive  I feel sure that the pleasure you get from contentment with your own work is one of the high spots of human happiness  Five more days passed and at last the work of dismantling parts of the ship was almost done  One supply container still had to be fastened to the part of the mother ship which was to wait for us on Phobos  Though the gravitational pull of the satellite itself was almost zero the manipulation of the huge cylindrical containers was very complicated and exhausting work and in spite of all our safety precautions we nearly had a tragic accident  The huge cylinder was in place but we still had to adjust its position slightly and at that moment Williams got tangled up in a safety rope and was too late in getting his foot out of the space between the container and the hull of the mother ship  The force of the containers inertia would have crushed his foot as it moved but for a metal toolbox which happened to be wedged under it  I hate to think what the consequences of a really bad accident in these conditions would have been  Finally we had to anchor the mother ship securely to the surface of the satellite  It may sound absurd to fasten down a body that could rest here for millions of years without moving as if we were hitching a horse to a post  However we were to take no risks at all and we had to envisage the possibility that some inner disturbance in the mass of Phobos or a meteorite swarm or the force of the exhaust gas when the convoy lifted off from Phobos might shift the part of the mother ship we were leaving behind  So we anchored her down to metal clamps driven deep into the rock  She was to wait here for over four hundred days a lifeless indifferent hulk in the middle of the wonderful play of light and shadow indifferent to the beauty of a billion repeat performances of a show featuring the fabulous figure of Mars  She was a lifeless hulkbut the big bright red orientation quadrants proclaimed that she belonged to the world of men  The dim glow of Phobos vanished from sight  We were back in orbit  We lost height rapidly stabilising at forty kilometres above the surface of Mars  We were now almost exactly on the plane of the Martian equator and the last stage of the flight was coming up  Captain Norton Chief Engineer Glennon and Morphy the meteorologist were in the control room  They had to make the final decision on a landing place  Three alternative sites for the expedition to land and set up a base had been planned  The first was the Deucalionis Regio area between Sinus Sabaeus and Pandorae Fretum a spot where particularly marked seasonal changes had been observed for decades  The second was the area on the northern borders of Aurorae Sinus long known as a changeable region as well as being thought in the past to contain a number of the famous canals and the third was on the eastern border of Syrtis Minor because of changes which had often been observed in its appearance  All these areas lay south of the equator and in choosing them the more favourable climatic conditions of the southern hemisphere had been taken into account as well of course as the immense interest that biologists took in them  The landing place was to be in one of the desert regions since photographs taken by unmanned probes sent to Mars in the course of Project Alpha showed a lot of roughness in the land formation of the seas  And the landing site must not be too far from these chosen areas since exploration must concentrate on them if we were to carry out the expeditions main astrobiological task the investigation into life on Mars  The final decision for one or other of these three landing sites must depend on meteorological conditions at the time  An endless panorama of virgin desert unrolled slowly beneath us like some fantastic film  However this was no time to give ourselves up to such impressions  A glance below us helped to analyse the situation the Syrtis Minor area was out  It was covered by a dull yellow misty veil of cloud over the whole vast plain from the southern border of the Elysium desert right over Aethiopis and Syrtis Major  Just now the Aurorae Sinus region was too close to the terminator the dividing line between light and dark on planets and their moons which meant that long shadows thrown by the sun now low in the sky impaired our view of it  Deucalionis Regio looked like the best spot to land  The red light in the roof gave the final signal for us to strap ourselves into our anti-gravitation seats and wait to see what the next few hours would bring  I heard the captains voice in the earphones of my closed helmet and then Glennon saying something  Then I felt nothing but an unbearable heaviness in my body and the taste of lead on my tongue   I lost all sense of time  At last a feeling of relief began to surface from the depths of pain  The unbearable pressure receded  We were now just twenty kilometres above the surface of Mars and the braking effect of the thin atmosphere began to make itself felt  Once more the thrust of the braking motors tightened my chest and I almost lost consciousness  Once more the pain was followed by a wonderful sense of relief  Now we ought to be making a soft landing  Instead I heard Glennons voice in my earphones again I didnt get the gist of what he was saying because of a new attack of pres- sure  I slipped back into apathetic resignation  At last the tormenting pressure around me let go like a gigantic snake loosening its coils from around my chest       An impact rocked the cabin  A green light was blinking in the silence  It was only gradually that I realised that this light meant the end of our long voyage  I just sat there  I couldnt bring myself to move  I felt appallingly tired not happy or excited at all  After all those days of weightlessness I was feeling the weight of my own body again  There was an unusually long silence from the main control room too  Finally the captain sent back news of our successful landing to Mission Control  His voice sounded as if it were coming through cotton wool      then it died away       I wasnt sure what had happened  Perhaps Id lost consciousness perhaps Id just gone to sleep  I tried to get out of my seat but I couldnt get my muscles to obey me and my will-power was protesting too  All I wanted to do was sleep and think of nothingsleep for a long long time  Finally making a superhuman effort I forced myself to stand up and leave the cabin  I staggered along the gangway like a drunk and saw someone standing by a porthole  It was Allan Watts  He was looking out in silence  McKinley staggered up too and stared out  God I feel like death he said closing his eyes  Leaning against the wall of the gangway I gazed out at the landscape through the porthole  All I could see was a brightly lit gently undulating rust-coloured plain blending mistily into the dark violet sky and a haze of yellowish dust  The weight of all the millions of cells in my own body was too much for me  I felt the sheer weight of life getting me down in the middle of this lifeless desert the kind of place where life weighs heaviest of all  PART First Man on Mars CHAPTER 11 I can only disentangle what actually happened during our first few hours on Mars with difficulty from my hazy recollections I cant be quite sure what was real and what is just guesswork  One thing I do know I did not have any remarkable solemn or uplifting thoughts  What I remember best is a splitting headache and having attacks of faintness and nausea  I also remember that during those first hours after our landing we used instruments to take readings which were to determine our living conditions in the cabins of the module this was probably done more from the pure instinct for self-preservation than as part of the scheduled programme  But all that is wrapped in a mist through which ghostly figures moved talking some language that seemed vaguely familiar to me  After sixteen hours sleep for the whole crew the signal to wake us came from the control room  It was seven oclock in the morning Mars time  I remember staggering over to a porthole to convince myself I was really awake but all I could see was thick yellowish fog  My brain was receiving impressions but refusing to make anything of them  Since I felt awful I forced myself at least to wonder why the appalling sense of weight could not be due to Martian conditions since roughly two-thirds of ones Earth weight could be discounted here  It must be the dosage of compensatory drugs in the bloodstream  Even long-term experiments and precise calculations are no substitute for reality  All I could do was hope that our natural powers of resistance every doctors indispensable ally would come to our aid  All the men were summoned to the clubroom  I was quite shaken by the sight of uswe looked so wretched  We could move in a human way again at last we could walk turn round or sit down at will and yet we seemed to have forgotten these natural human movements  We were staggering uncertainly around all trying to sit down or at least lean against something  Captain Norton and OBrien were not doing much better than the rest of us  The captain asked Watts and me how long we thought it would take to get acclimatised and I must admit that we couldnt answer that one very precisely  Still one thing was certain there could be no question of doing any kind of physical or mental work for the next twenty-four hours  So we set that time aside for rest and recreation everyone according to his own taste and his physical condition  As it turned out nearly everyone went off to sleep in the cabins  The captain himself went to the control room where Jenkins utterly exhausted was waiting by the receivers for transmissions from Mission Control  I stayed in the Club with Watts and OBrien  Talking was a strain so we sat there in silence  The dim gloomy light that filtered through the portholes making them look as if they were clouded over gradually grew brighter  Well Ive always admired athletes said OBrien at last  Since Im a biologist I suppose I ought to be interested in any organisms potentialities   I tell you something thoughIm more interested in whatever it is that drives the organism than the actual amount of weight lifted or the number of kilometres run  Ive even had the notion that the human will like the universe has no limits at allnow thats heretical if you like We just have to find out what it really consists of       I can tell you what I could do with at this moment  Id just like to have enough will-power to get up and go out of here because I feel so sick Not much to ask is it A dog or a cat could do it Whereupon he got up and staggered out  Watts went to lie down too  My head was still throbbing but I forced myself to go up to the observatory  The steps which in weightlessness had served only as a reminder of Earth conditions were now an instrument of torture  I took one step at a time as I used to long ago when I was a small child and all the same my face was running with sweat  I told myself I had to do this in the interests of science  What I really badly wanted to do was to escape this overpowering apathy  Wellgarth was sitting in an armchair in the observatory his head bent  He was asleep  After a few moments when my pulse and breathing had calmed down and the faintness and the blurring of my eyes had worn off I looked around  My glance went to the large portholes  I could feel the headache receding into the depths of my skull the pressure on my chest relaxing and my feverish nausea disappearing  So this was the land of my youthful dreams Everything I was seeing was actually real independent of my own senses The monotonous desert stretched around us in every direction as far as the eye could reach veiled in a thin haze of dust  There were shallow craters in the ground and slight rises  The red-brown remnants of weathered rocks stuck up in a few places  The rising sun shone red and strangely small through a haze on the horizon and there were stars twinkling in the sky which was dark violet almost black  The frosty grandeur of the untouched desert dispelled all physical sensations but that of cold  Im not sure how long I stood there but at last I decided to wake Wellgarthit seemed criminal to sleep through this sunrise It was difficult to wake him even after a lot of shaking but finally he opened his eyes and looked blankly at me  In silence I jerked my head towards the portholes  He looked out shook himself and got out of his chair  We both stood and watched the sunrise in silence  To simplify the measurement of time we were using a specially constructed chronometer which divided the Martian day into twenty-four units  The first twenty-four hours were over  An icy shroud had veiled the stars in the black impenetrable night and then the sun rose again from the murky pink haze and climbed the dark and starry sky to its zenith  There was not much change in our physical condition but after consulting me and Watts the captain decided that we must press on with the most essential workthe building of a base camp  The first men to set foot on the virgin soil of Mars were the members of McKinleys geological group  Their job was to test the ground for firmness the whole weight of the star-shaped convoy was resting on it  From the slant of the floor inside it was obvious that we had not landed on an ideally flat surface  The arms connecting the module containing the living quarters to the rest of the structure could be adjusted to redress the slant but the main thing was to find out just how the freighters were positioned and how their storerooms containing supplies machinery and all the equipment for scientific exploration of Mars could be reached from outside  We were still all so tired and lethargic that we couldnt summon up the proper amount of enthusiasm for the first steps taken by Man on Mars  Nothing was working out quite as wed imagined and planned it  The whole thing seemed quite commonplace we let down the ladder and five men in spacesuits climbed down it and left their footprints in the friable ground  McKinley sent back radio reports of this first trip via the control room  Our exhaust gas had swept the top layer of dust away from our landing site so that only the weathered rock was left  The second freighter had landed with its hull on a rock that was sticking up out of the ground  A large part of the ship was buckled including the liftoff and braking motors and driven partly into the hull itself  We werent worried about the damage to the engines which had now done their work for everbut how much damage had been done in the storerooms How much of our costly equipment had been harmed or crushed beyond repair The sliding door in the side of the freighter refused to open  I watched through a porthole as the five men in their spacesuits struggled with the heavy door  They tried crowbars they tried a heavy hammer but nothing would budge it  Over the radio I heard McKinley talking to the captain suggesting an oxygen burner  But fuel for our caterpillar tractors formed part of the second freighters cargo and it was just possible that a fuel tank might be damaged and leaking so we could not use flame  Finally there was nothing for it but to drill off the damaged bar on which the heavy door slid  The work took four hours  By now we noticed that the daylight was getting weaker though it was only just after midday and visibility was poorer  The dark violet sky paled the stars disappeared and the sun high in the sky looked redder  A yellowish fog was gradually coming down over the whole landscape a dust haze which was already so thick that looking through the modules portholes we could hardly see the second freighter  At last they got the door open and soon we knew the results of the accident the small caterpillar inside had tom loose from its moorings but no great harm seemed to have been done apart from a dent in the bonnet  The only damage worth mentioning was to several duralumin tanks containing supplies of chemicals for the filter station of the water re-cycling system which were rather battered and a broken spare searchlight intended for the lighthouse  When the men took their spacesuits off after coming back up from the ground Watts and I gave them a thorough examination  They were all right though tired they complained of the humidity from the oxygen regenerators but this could hardly be a malfunctioneverything technological had been thoroughly testedit would be due to the fact that the mens bodies were not acclimatised to Martian conditions yet and were producing more sweat than usual  The cloud of dust hung in the atmosphere all the rest of the day  The yellowish light that filtered through the portholes made us all look ill  No one felt like talking much  According to the detailed plans for the building of the base camp priority was given to getting the main electrical power plant going and starting on the construction of the big radio antenna the radio station and the lighthouse  We were to let down the module containing our living quarters by adjusting the connecting arms so that it would be low enough for us to do without the ladder which was tricky and dangerous to negotiate  We were also to set up a large radio telescope and a meteorological station  How long ago was it when all this was only a dream Well our dream had come true but it had gone cold on us  At five in the afternoon Morphy recorded a temperature of two degrees on the planets surface while it was minus thirty-seven degrees at the level of the observatory fifteen metres above the ground  At six oclock it got so dark that we switched on small orientation lights we had to save power now  I went into the Club where I found Gray sitting in the dark playing a mouth organ a tiny instrument which he held in the palm of his hand  Sometimes it sounded like a child crying  He was playing to himself I dont think he was on Mars at all at that moment  I sat in the dark for some time listening to those sounds of Earth trapped here in a hermetically sealed room surrounded by the bitter cold and the chilly silence of the unknown  CHAPTER 12 For the next three days the yellow dust haze restricted our visibility to a few dozen metres  The weak light cast no shadows intensifying slightly only at midday when the sun was at its height and giving the whole base the look of a backdrop in a film studio  Nothing seemed real  The men working to adjust the connecting arms and let the module down to ground level looked like ghosts  The dim light magnified their spacesuits and it all resembled some weird film  Work on the building of the base went very slowly because of the crews poor physical condition  We kept having to cut the work shifts short and relieve each other more often  Headaches and attacks of dizziness were frequent  Williams fell off the main girder though he was on a safety rope the slackened rope flung him against a traverse girder and he hit his back against it and stayed hanging there  After a while we heard his cries for help through our earphones  The blow on the back of his spacesuit had damaged his oxygen pack and he was beginning to struggle for breath  He was unconscious before we could get him into the cabin  Watts made certain that there was nothing else wrong with him apart from a bruised elbow but he was unable to work in a spacesuit for several days  After three days we were able to let the module far enough down to be easily accessible from the ground of Mars  The heavy physical work had exhausted the mens last reserves of strengthand suddenly for inexplicable reasons our radio communications with Earth got worse  Or so Jenkins claimed in fact contact had been broken completely  All this meant that the expedition as a whole was in a poor way  The horrible yellow fog seemed to be making its way right into our brains  The meteorologist Morphy was the only man whose stomach didnt turn at the mere sight of this revolting phenomenon  He told us the dust haze was of great interest because of the way it mitigated the extreme variations of temperature on Mars  The highest daytime temperature of the last three days had hovered between three and five degrees though we might have expected it to be very much higher and similarly by night we recorded only minus thirty-nine degrees instead of the expected minus sixty-five     On the fourth day things improvedat least the dust haze sank to earth  I say earth though the ground under our feet was not Earth at all but the word was the symbol of something familiar and certain and that was what we called it all the time we were on Mars  The surrounding landscape was getting clearer all the time but there was still a dimness in the atmosphere the horizon and the sky merged together both bluish grey where they met  The dust haze did sink to the ground but now the dark sky where stars twinkled even at midday had a pale violet veil over it and in the middle of the day a huge yellowish circle of light green at its rim formed around the sun  Morphy was thrilled by this phenomenon  There wasnt much else to feel thrilled about  I felt the captain was getting edgy work on the base had hardly begun after five days on Mars  He was right to worry  In theory we knew all about the change-over from weightlessness to Martian conditions but in practice things worked out rather differently  The human organism can be slow to adapt  Perhaps Im prejudicedfor professional reasons so to speak  I am sure that the root of all our troubles lies in the subconscious and here we had subconscious worries about air water life itself in the middle of conditions which were utterly hostile to life  I reminded myself bitterly of the torrent of words in the newspapers before the start of the Mars shot  Conquering planets is a lot easier on paper  At this time with the health of the expedition not improving at allsome of us were even getting worsewe lost the most important thing of all our sense of belonging to the human race  Contact with Earth had been broken for several days now  After a brief consultation with Jenkins and OBrien and with Watts and myself on the medical side the captain gave orders to put up a large antenna the one thing that could ensure reliable communications with Mission Control  Our sluggish bodies crawled back into the heavy spacesuits  This time every member of the expedition was on duty except for those at the controls of the air generating system and the heating and water re-cycling systems  At last five days after touchdown I had the chance to set foot on Martian soil myself and as I stepped on to the rust-red ground a thought shot through my head  It was like seeing fragments of an old film all my years of childhood my boyhood dreams years of arduous study years of renunciation and sacrifice for something that was to give my life meaningand now the moment had come  Every second of my life had been aimed towards this moment  Perhaps it wasnt quite the way I had imagined itno it certainly was notbut in its stark simplicity it was still a great moment  The foundations dug for the bases of the two twenty-metre antenna masts were really our first geological probes  According to McKinley the scientific gain was very small  At the bottom of the pits we dug two metres deep we still found loose rock mingled with debris from the rock on which the second freighter stood  In the mens present condition digging the foundations was particularly hard work  Everyone welcomed Glennons decision that two metres was deep enough since the antennae would be stabilised by cables anchored to strong clamps in the solid rocks which stuck up out of the ground here and there  The mechanical equipment of the expedition included four small caterpillar tractorswe christened them the Lizards  Each tractor had room for only two men but it could pull an incredibly heavy load on a trailer  They were brightly coloured so that we could tell them apart on the Martian surface we called them the Yellow Blue Green and Red Lizards  These small tractors soon showed how useful they were the masts once assembled were quickly erected with their help  Once the first antenna was working we managed to restore contact with Mission Control and our commu- nications were excellent again  Jenkins brightened up  The big antenna was working our radio contact with Earth was all right but we had another worry the exact location of our landing place on the map  I noticed an odd tension between the captain and the chief engineer when they were discussing the subject it was something I couldnt explain to myself  Privately I asked OBrien what he made of it  He told me there had been a difference of opinion between the captain and Glennon about how far they had deviated from the actual point chosen for our landing  The captain feels sure there was an error during the landing manoeuvre OBrien said  You know Cosby myself I either believe in a man implicitly or not at all  Glennon knows the captain doesnt really trust him so hes afraid of making the smallest mistake  He has a positive complex about itwhich is just the way to make a big mistake  He was unwilling to say any more  OBrien of course was the scientific leader of the expedition and recently Id felt that he was withdrawing from everything that was not directly connected with his function as second-in-command  We could only determine our precise landing site with the help of our small two-seater jet helicopter which was still inside the third freighter  We had not been able to use it yet because of the poor visibility  Fogthat was the symbol of those early days on Mars  Assembly of the electric power plant was going desperately slowly  Morphy the meteorologist had a slight difference of opinion with the captain because he needed two men to help him erect his meteorological station and the captain was unwilling to spare anyone  Those capable of physical exertion must all help with essential priority work on the base as Morphy finally had to agree  For the present he could only dream of his cylindrical steel cabin with its thermometers barometers and other instruments fifty metres from the main part of the base  I kept wondering why reality differed so fundamen- tally from all our plans  Were we really the same men who had planned a landing on Mars perfect in every detail just a year back During one of my routine check-ups I found that the captain had quite a high temperature  He flatly refused to have a more thorough examination saying that he felt perfectly all right  I couldnt help it I lost my temper  Captain I exploded in this room 1 make the decisions and give the orders I was quite surprised at the effect this outburst had on him he let me examine him with no further objection  Unfortunately I couldnt find out the cause of his temperature all I could do was prescribe drugs and physical rest to lower it  I couldnt order him to take any other kind of rest but physical  When he left my surgery he apologised for his rudeness  Next morning there was great excitement  Everyone was crowding around the portholes  The haze had dispersed overnight and for the first time we saw the whole panorama of the landscape around us  From the observatory which was situated at the highest point of the camp we saw an endless sea of dust with low rocks sticking up here and there weathered and worn smooth by corrosion the wearing down of rock by the action of sand or dust  The dust drifts threw long shadows in the sunlight  The western horizon stood out bright orange against the dark ultramarine of the sky while the bright pink ridge of a plateau gleamed far away to the south-west  The whole scene was full of the grandeur of an untamed desert  A consultation was going on in the navigation cabin  The captain whose temperature had dropped was studying maps of Mars with McKinley and Compton  When I invaded the cabin to protest that he shouldnt have got up he took no notice at all  His manner was calm and icy and I knew this mask of his too well not to guess what it hid  McKinley and Compton were silent  Norton was saying There you areEdom Promontorium  In the south-west not the north McKinley take Lawrenson and go and get some pictures An hour and a half later the Dragonflyour name for the helicopterwas standing on the sandy plain  From up above in the observatory it looked like a disc striped red and silver  Lawrenson in his spacesuit pushed back the transparent windshield and climbed in  A few moments later we heard the hiss of the jets and the Dragonfly disappeared in a cloud of dust  When the dust settled a little I could see the helicopter hovering at a height of twenty metres  It gradually climbed higher till it was a hundred metres up described a circle came down and landed on the spot from which it had taken off  It performed this manoeuvre five times  Then two hours were spent checking all the instruments on board  Strictly speaking the tests should have taken much longer but it was vital to determine the exact location of our base and no one could tell how long the present ideal weather would last  When Lawrenson reported that the tests had all gone off all right the captain gave permission for take-off  Enveloped in another cloud of dust the Dragonfly with Lawrenson and McKinley on board rose into the air from the base described a circle and flew south  A few moments later it was only a flying star in the dark sky  After an hour and a half the Dragonfly came back to base  While Sheldon and Trott pushed the machine into its hangar in the third freighter and McKinley and Lawrenson changed out of their spacesuits in the pressure cabin Compton developed the photographs which were to tell us exactly where we were  OBrien seemed the most excited of all  The photographs were carefully studied in the navigation cabin  The captain could now pin down our actual landing site accurately by identifying vital details en- tered on the maps of Mars after the unmanned probes had taken close pictures  We were on the equator in the Edom desert some six hundred kilometres north of our planned landing-place in Deucalionis Regio This was shattering news  It meant that if we wanted to get to Deucalionis Regio we would have to make our way through over three hundred kilometres of desert and then go another three hundred through the wild rugged Sinus Sabaeus region  I was not present at the survey being made in the navigation cabin only the captain OBrien McKinley and Glennon were there  I dont know just what happened and I never really found out but eventually Glennon came out of the cabin stony-faced and after that he was the most silent member of the whole expedition  Even the talkative McKinley wouldnt tell us anything  I remembered certain oddities about our landing manoeuvre and OBriens comment that the chief engineer could make a mistake just because he was so afraid to make one   The captain called a meeting of everyone to evaluate the situation  The scientific research programme was most affected by the change from the planned landing-place so OBrien took the chair  The meeting lasted five hours  OBrien insisted that we must try to reach Deucalionis Regio but for the present no one had any clear idea how the attempt could be safely made  From the moment OBrien took the chair the captain became very brusque  He emphasised the fact that while it was his duty to ensure the success of the scientific mission in every way he could he was not going to tolerate unnecessary risks  We had the technical equipment to make the attemptthat was no problem  We had four caterpillar tractors plus trailers a large mobile air-conditioned laboratory on another tractor the Dragonfly plenty of fuel and provisions oxygen systems functioning perfectly and a complete outfit of scientific instruments  No one could know for sure how this equipment would stand the test of field work that could be a problem  The helicopter looked like the easiest way to reach the scientifically important area  Unfortunately it could only fly for three hours at a stretch so going at a speed of 200 k p h  we could at best reach the edge of the Sinus Sabaeus area roughly half way between here and Deucalionis Regio and that would mean no reserves of fuel for the return journey  Naturally the captain was dead against that idea  The only possibility was setting up way stations for the helicopter in advance  It was finally decided that we must rework all our previous plans but our priority was to finish building the main base  CHAPTER 13 The weather which we guessed was exceptionally good lasted for twenty-six days  At last our physical lethargy disappeared giving way to an optimistic mood which had a miraculous effect on the crews health  The building of the base was going faster now too  The power plant was working and no particular difficulties beset the erection of the big radio telescope  There were plenty of problems of course but normal ones  For instance there turned out to be several flawed components in the power plant  Frost damaged the insulation and fine dust stopped up the filters  During an overnight frost of eighty below zero some pipes froze because of damage to their insulation during the assembly of the plant  But these were small difficulties compared to those anticipated in Project Alphas plans and quite insignificant compared with the difficulties we were to have later on  The only shadow at this time was the captains health  He had a high temperature every evening and neither Watts nor I could explain it  It bothered us all the more as the health of the others improved  How- ever the captain kept saying that he wasnt really ill and I thought it was partly his own fault that the trouble didnt clear up he was orderly even pedantically so but he refused to rest as I had told him to  OBrien was completely absorbed in reworking the plans for the scientific expedition  It often seemed to me that he was hardly with us in spirit at all  Morphy the meteorologist finally got his small station set up too  It was equipped with automatic recording apparatus the round steel cabin stood on a rocky ledge to one side of the base so that the anemometer would not be influenced by possible turbulence in the atmosphere  It looked like a miniature red lighthouse  Inside there was only just room to sit down but Morphy was happy to have all his instruments working at last and to be able to watch their needles scribbling mysterious poetry that only he could understand on an endless strip of paper  He gave the cabin the romantic name of Aurora and was much annoyed when McKinley said the thing looked to him like a sort of rustic lavatory  Wed been on the base for thirty-five days now and the area explored so far could be contained within a radius of a few dozen metres  That may sound curious but it is easily explained during our early days on Mars the expeditions physical state was such that every step we took in our heavy duty spacesuits cost us a lot  We were using the caterpillars only for work on the building of the basenot that the boundless spaces of virgin desert around us were not tempting  Quite the opposite  Our happiest moments at this time were the evenings we spent in the Club even if we sometimes had to sit in the dark the electric power plant was at minimum output for reasons of economy  But these evenings of excited argument re-awoke a sense of the unique magic of our experience  None of us guessed how the precious seconds were running out  A yellowish fog darkened the atmosphere again on the forty-first day  When he checked his readings that morning Morphy found a rise of nine degrees in the night temperature and for the first time since the meteorological station started work a movement of the anemometer had been recorded  But by early morning all was still again  That morning a group of six men finished setting up the radio telescope while another eight were working on the roof of the power plant  A few minutes before eleven oclock everything suddenly went dark  Through the porthole I could see the ground around the base disappearing in a murky torrent like the flooding of a ghostly river rising above its banks and at the same time I heard a rushing noise that reminded me of a distant waterfall  A few moments later I felt the floor quiver  The distant rushing sound changed to the deafening roar of a storm that hurled vast amounts of dust against the metal walls of the spaceship  The floor under my feet was shaking it felt like a distant earthquake  Someones voice came over the loudspeaker but there was so much noise that I couldnt make out the words  I realised it must be an alarm signal  Fourteen of our men surprised by the sudden storm were out there in danger of their lives  I hurried to the changing cabin to find Morphy and Compton there already  The procedure of putting on a spacesuit had always struck me as tedious but this time it felt like a nightmare in which I could never never finish getting dressed  Meanwhile we gathered from reports from the control room that radio contact with the eight men at work on the roof of the power plant had not been broken and everything there was all right  They were safe on the side of the plant away from the wind  But the other six men were not answering to radio calls  Suddenly the howling of wind stopped  The silence seemed unnatural and oppressive  After equalising pressure in the exit cabin we pushed the reinforced door aside its mechanism was working with difficulty  A torrent of fine sandy dust swept over our feet  Outside it was black as pitch visibility was down to two metres  Compton turned back for a safety rope and only when we had fastened one end to the handrail of the exit platform could we set off in what we judged to be the direction of the power plant  In our earphones we heard McKinleys report relayed via the control room that his whole group of eight had dug itself out of a dust dune  We called back ourselves warning the group not to leave the power plant  The wind had come on so unexpectedly that no one could tell what might happen next moment  Meanwhile we kept trying to raise the other group but there was no answer  We waded laboriously through a layer of unusually fine sand sinking in to our knees  After a while we came to a metal wall  Judging by its curve it wasnt the power plant but the outside of a freighter  It might be the second freighter if so the power plant should be over to the right  Sure enough we found it a few moments later  Several human figures in spacesuits appeared in the greyness that distorted everything so oddly  We reported back to the control room and after consulting the captain we all made our way back to the pressure chamber along the rope  Visibility had not improved at all and every second was precious  With three more ropes we set off for the spot where the group had been at work on the radio telescope  We searched the whole area sometimes sinking up to our hips in fine sand but we found no trace of our friends  All we heard in our earphones was the slight hum of the machinery in the power plant  We were haunted by the thought that a sudden gust of wind might have flung our companions to the ground swept them away and buried them under a mountain of dust  We searched the whole base systematically keeping in touch with each other by means of our ropes and the radio  By now we were badly worried  Then McKinley reported finding the sliding door of the third freighter which housed one of the tractors left open  A sense of enormous relief swept over us  They might have taken shelter in the storerooms of the freighter  But after a while we heard McKinley again  All he had found was a vast dust drift covering the Lizard and the fuel tanks  We reached the fourth freighter  In the murky light we saw that the sliding door was three-quarters buried in dust  The thought that our friends might be buried somewhere under our feet forced itself upon us we felt appallingly powerless  Then we heard excited shouts from McKinley in our earphones  When we caught up with him he pointed to the place where the dust dune met the wall and the door  We saw regular vibrations at the spot where the top layer of dust touched the metal plates  McKinley put his armoured glove against the door  The metal was quivering at regular intervals from blows inside the freighter  Our depression vanished at once  McKinley kicked the door three times and got the same reply from inside  Now we could see why the group had sent back no messageshut in the insulated steel hull of the ship they were cut off from radio contact with us  Vaux and Briggs went back for shovels as we impatiently began to dig the great dust drift away with our hands  Suddenly a doubt rose in our minds  Were they all safe in there After two hours strenuous work we had dug away enough of the dust drift to slide the door open  Six men came out  This short violent storm was a warning to us  Poor Morphy had to put up with a lot of snide remarks about the value of meteorology  The othersonly joking of coursesaid he was less use to us than a watchdog which would at least bark when danger threatened  To which Morphy replied with gallows humour that then hed have to keep barking all the time  Outside it did not get light again all day and the whole of the next day the atmosphere was still thick with fine almost weightless dust  We stretched orientation ropes over the whole base area when we had to move about  After this incident which might have ended in tragedy we couldnt allow ourselves to take any kind of risks  When Morphy and Compton went out along a rope to the rocky ledge where the meteorological station stood and came back with the news that the station had disappeared Morphy was in despair  He told us he hadnt seen a trace of it anywhere near the rock  All three ropes anchoring the steel cabin had been tom out of the weathered stone along with their clamps  Visibility improved a lot next day and Morphy set off once again to the site of his meteorological station  He searched the whole area and found a rope sticking out of a dust dune  After a whole days hard work he and Compton triumphantly dug the almost undamaged cabin out of the dust and hauled it back to the rock  Some of his instruments had been smashed or badly damaged but his valuable records had survived  A day later Aurora was back in place her bright red paint shining in her surroundings like a living cactus flower in an inhospitable desert  This time they fastened her to the rock with clamps almost a metre long  Morphy set up his apparatus again and once more he was the happiest man on Marsnot too difficult considering the population count  There was not much to be really happy about  The roof of the power plant had been damaged as well as the half-finished lighthouse which the wind had demolished  But the storm was not really so worrying as the state of the captains health  He was regularly feverish every evening and it was undermining his strength  His eyes had receded into their sockets and were shining too much and the lymph glands in his neck were swollen  I have to admit that Watts and I were helpless  We discussed it at length we tried experiments but the cause of the captains illness lay somewhere outside our experience  What got me down most was having to watch the struggle of mind and body at such close quarters  The captain simply would not admit to being ill he kept assuring us obstinately that he was quite all right  I never heard so much as a tinge of concern for himself in his voice  The expedition was his whole life  In view of this I dared not order him to go to bed and I felt I was right  OBrien reacted oddly to the captains illness he just took no notice of it  At first I believed he was so busy preparing the scientific research programme that he was unaware of anything going on around him but when I made some remark about the captains health he said Well the mans been ill for a long time now  Megalomania thats what hes gotits incurable too  Its not an easy thing for me to talk about whether I like it or not Im cast in the role of the jealous unsuccessful candidate who didnt get the job of captain  Do you see what a tricky position Im in Cosby As they say anything I say can be taken down and used in evidence against me       all the same Ill venture to say it to you  The captain is sick but its not this fever of yours  That will pass the other thing wont  Im sorry about it toosorrier than you probably think  Hes not my rival still less my enemy  Id say hes a friend I have lost  The captain thinks highly of you I said  Well yes he replied  But thats all  Dust still lingered in the atmosphere several days after the squall stopping up the dust filters of the main machinery in the power plant so that they had to be changed frequently  Yet another of our calculations that was working out wrong  Changing the filters like changing the filters of the water re-cycling system was a horrible job  The dust kept us busy  It got in everywhere the airlock was not absolutely hermetic  It even made its way into our living quarters by way of the pressure chamber and changing cabin as we could tell from the filters of the air regenerator pumps  There was a fair amount of radio-activity in this dust so that was one more worry  The dust gave Morphy more trouble than anyone  It clung to the contact points of his instruments and impaired their efficiency  It got through the protective coverings of the rolls of paper stuck to the tips of the needles and interrupted the lines of the diagrams they drew  Morphy was endlessly patient in keeping his meteorological station going  When we had cleared away the fine dust from the places where it upset the running of the base we wondered what lay ahead of us when the summer winds set in  It was essential to build a system of barriers and shelters before then one that would keep the entrances to the storerooms from being drifted up  We even thought that in the last resort we might have to protect them by tunnels of elastic insulating material which could be bent into an upside-down U shape  The dust out there on the vast surface of the desert had worse troubles in store  None of us dared guess how the Lizards and most important the mobile laboratory would manage in this terrain  But the day when we would have to venture out into it was inevitably approaching  CHAPTER 14 Sixty days after we landed the base was finished except for a few details which were all to do with alterations and amendments of the original scheme  For instance one antenna mast had to be differently sited and set up some fifty metres from base after our experience with the dust storm we were afraid that if the mast fell it might damage the power plant which was vital to the base  Another detail was the demolition of the ramp we had laboriously built outside the door of the third freighter which housed the mobile laboratory  The least breath of wind piled dust up on this ramp making it difficult to slide the door open  We knew the summer winds would mostly be coming from the north-east so we decided to use the door on the opposite side of the freighter away from the wind and we had to put the ramp up there all over again  Later we found that this wasnt the perfect solution either  We could sense anxiety and impatience in the messages coming up from Mission Control  They obviously thought we were taking too long to build the base in relation to the whole schedule and our reports on the crews health were not likely to bring them much joy either  Perhaps they even suspected us of concealing the true state of affairs  In fact there was one thing we were concealing Captain Nortons own state of health and we were doing so on his own orders  All the men understood how the captain felt about it and they respected his attitude  His thin face with its sunken eyes was far from being calm or cheerful but the men would joke with him whenever they could and I had a feeling that he was pleased they respected his wishes so unreservedly  At such moments his face so thin now that it looked ascetic became quite softened you might almost say that something boyish looked out of his eyes some hidden shyness or a sort of gratitude he found difficulty in expressing  But he never looked like that when he was with OBrien  He stayed polite but cool towards him  Of course I wasnt the only one to notice it I learned later that all the men were discussing it a lot but in private  It wasnt gossip it was genuine concern  Time was like a river flowing into the unknowna river full of treacherous currents  We knew we had a hard task ahead of us and that was why I was so worried about the captain  I was often almost in despair at my own helplessness I began to have doubts of the value of medical knowledge  One day when Watts and I were reviewing the case yet again Watts suggested Maybe its something quite slight  Some tiny little detaillike a tooth say  See what I mean An ordinary infection incubating while we were in weightlessness and now coming out under Martian conditions  I stared at him blankly for a minute  Then slowly various things began to click into place  Sometimes one gets a flash of genius which looks like sheer nonsense said Watts  We went straight to the captain and there was a surprise in store for us  The captain admitted that some while back he actually had pulled out an aching tooth himself with a pair of pliers borrowed from Jenkinss equipment  In reply to Wattss astonished query as to why he had extracted the tooth himself he said I wanted to prove that I could do a little thing like that on my own  I was ashamed to mention it afterwards  I didnt want anyone to think I was afraid of the pain  Watts was left speechless  It was some time before he could utter a word  Well Captain he said at last in view of your position all I can allow myself to do is to describe your conduct as incredibly naive Then we had a good look at our patients oral cavity  We were afraid the infection might be so far advanced that treatment would be impossible under present conditions  But after a few days intensive medical care Captain Norton was improving  Well do you still think we deserve the title of Homo Sapiens demanded Watts when we were alone again  He couldnt see why the captain would prefer to suffer excruciating pain and endanger his life rather than admit his mistake  No youve got it wrong I said  Your thinkings too primitive Allan  The captain hadnt made any mis-take  He was demonstrating his will-power to himself and to us  Demonstrating your will-power that sort of way is crazy said Watts indignantly  Well you said yourself that a flash of genius can look like sheer nonsense Watts laughed  Im not taking you on at this kind of argumentjust wait till you get appendicitis Youll be glad of my primitive thinking then Naturally the captain didnt make an immediate miraculous recovery  He had lost a lot of weight and some rather disturbing changes had taken place in his bloodstream in particular there was a drop in the red corpuscles  We now had to stop him getting any worse  At the same time relations between the captain and OBrien were getting quite a lot worse  At one conference when the captain suggested putting up an emergency camp right outside the module in case an exceptionally long dust storm drifted up our access to the freighters OBrien lost his temper  He shouted angrily that he wasnt going to curtail the scientific mission any more on account of these never-ending safety precautions here at base  The scientific value of our studies here in this sterile desert cant be any more than what we got from the stuff the unmanned probes sent back he cried  We didnt need a twenty-man expedition for that The captain interrupted just as angrily  7 didnt pick on this sterile desert Thats just ityou did exploded OBrien  Mores the pity  And he walked out  At this Glennon who was also present got up too  May I leave the meeting Captain he asked  In your opinion Ive displayed complete incompetence in which case I cant see any point in sitting around when I cant give you any advice  I think youd better just tell me what to do and Ill do it You may go said the captain and he started to discuss the erection of an emergency camp with McKinley and Silcott  Winds carrying dust and fine sand were rarer than we had anticipated  Once the morning frost dispersed the sun usually shone all day  Morphys readings showed little variation in temperature from one day to another  So long as the atmosphere was not clouded with dust maximum temperature at midday was twenty degrees above zero on the ground and five above zero at two metres up  Night temperature sank to minus thirty in fog and about minus seventy when the sky was clear  While a group of eight men were working on the emergency camp another group of six tested the performance of the Lizards with loaded trailers near the base  The captain also gave the go-ahead for the Dragonfly to take off  It was to set up a second radio direction finder beyond the camp this system would be indispensable when we needed to establish our exact position on long-term expeditions  We had already put one finder up at base and since when we were getting a fix on a position the lines drawn from the point reached must not form too acute an angle with the two finder points and our most important objective was to get further south a spot roughly two hundred kilometres east of the base was chosen for the second finder  It was in an area of the Edom desert where the photographic maps indicated we would find rocky highlands  At last something was happening to relieve the monotony of our days at base  Two Lizards set out from base to make test drives with loaded trailers  There were two men on each Lizard and one on each of the fully loaded trailers  I felt that the men working on the emergency camp envied the othersat least I did when I watched them go from up in the observatory  The vehicles gleamed in the bright sun shimmering in the dust like huge real brightly coloured lizards  But only until they drove into the first dust dune at that moment they vanished in a yellow cloud  The Blue Lizard stuck in a large dune some hundred metres from base  When the swirling dust settled I could see that the tractor had sunk in right up to the drivers cab  It was a good half-hour before the second Lizard could free it from the fine sand  From up in the observatory we had a good view of the surface of the desert shaped by the wind over mil- lions of years  Patches of bare ground stood out against pink dunes of fine sand partly covered by drifts of greyish yellow dust  The windward side of the dunes of heavier matter was a different colour from the rest of them  In theory the windward sides of the ridges of the dunes ought to provide the best going for the tractors but we soon found out how things were in practice  Both Lizards vanished behind a big dune and failed to reappear  I hurried to the control room  Jenkins was already in contact with both crews who said that the two Lizards had sunk into a deep dust drift  The drivers were asking for a third tractor to come and pull them out  It was not a very encouraging start  When all three Lizards returned to base OBrien who had been on the test drive was in a thoroughly bad mood  I guessed what the matter was six hundred kilometres of treacherous desert lay between us and Deucalionis Regio  However the drivers claimed that it was all a question of experience and the important thing was to drive on firm ground even if it meant making detours  We should have to get through dune areas in single file in such a way that the second tractor did not drive past before the one in front was safely through  Our forays into the Edom desert didnt look like being much fun  The same morning Lawrenson and McKinley took off in the Dragonfly  She rose vertically above the base then flew due east and soon disappeared over the dark violet horizon  It was fine weather  The motionless desert around the base with the sun almost directly overhead looked like a bright sea with frozen waves a still from a film showing a stony ocean with the gleaming island of the Edom Promontorium range on its south-west horizon  At last an hour and a half later Lawrenson called back to the control room  Reception was not too good  He reported landing at a suitable place almost exactly according to schedule and he described their surroundings as a hill badly snarled up with boulders and fis- sured rocks  They were going to take the radio mast up on one of the rocks and anchor it securely as a precaution against storms  Then radio contact was broken  After three in the afternoon a slight wind rose  Fine dust swirled up from the dunes like smoke from volcanic ground  The horizon grew hazy merging with the sky  We began to feel alarmed about the Dragonfly  No one put it into so many wordsbut we could all imagine what it would be like to be flying in the poor visibility of a dust haze or even a storm  At three-thirty Lawrenson and McKinley radioed back  There had been a hitch in putting up the direction finder the place they originally picked had turned out to be no good  The rock was weatherworn and crumbled as soon as they drove in a clamp for the safety rope so they had to find a more compact rock  They told us dust was rising from the desert and they were ready to take off  An hour later the Dragonfly appeared above the base came down and landed a few metres outside its hangar in the third freighterand none too soon  The wind was gathering force and the big antenna masts were already disappearing in the haze  OBrien wanted to give the mobile laboratory a field test  He asked the captains permission which was refused because we were still building the emergency camp  Captain Norton said he couldnt spare anyone who was trained to drive the heavy vehicle but he assured OBrien that the camp would be ready in three days at the latest and three days could hardly be a vital loss to science  OBrien did not accept the captains decision meekly  You can leave me to judge whats a vital loss to science he said acidly  In fact the camp was ready in three days and I hoped that now there would be less friction or none at all between the technological security of the expedition and its scientific mission  I took part myself in the mobile laboratorys test drive  The thing was officially described as an astro-laboratory and we had christened it Astra  When the vehicle drove off the ramp it looked massive and impregnable  But no sooner were we two hundred metres from base than we stuck in a dust dune  Williams managed to get us out by reversing  This meant we had to abandon our idea of driving on the windward side of dunes  Patches of sand alternated with patches of dust and it was hard to judge the depth of the dust drifts into which the vehicle would sink as if into feathers before we were in them  After about half an hour the engine suddenly stalled and refused to start again  When several attempts to re-start it had failed we radioed back to the control room asking for all four Lizards to come and try to drag out first the Astras trailer and then the vehicle itself  We sat in the big cabin with OBrien looking out through the round porthole into the hopeless desert with the base camp about a kilometre away  It looked like a glittering toy in the middle of the sea of dust under the great vault of the dark sky we didnt feel like saying anything  Eight crew members came along with the four Lizards  Two Lizards towed the big trailer back to base and then returned for the crippled Astra  But all the tractors attempts to get the big vehicle moving failed  We heard the captain over our radios ordering all men back to base we were wasting fuel unnecessarily  After we got back and took off our heavy spacesuits we didnt have the usual feeling of relief and lightness  The sight of the abandoned Astra standing there in the desert was like a nightmare  CHAPTER 15 The Deucalionis Regio area where traces of the existence of life on Mars were said to have been detected seemed quite beyond our reach without the mobile laboratory  It was six hundred kilometres as the crow flies between base and Deucalionis Regio and the detours we would have to make would mean that the way was longerhow much longer we couldnt calculate  That distance was like a red pencil mark scored through all our plans  It would be insane to undertake the march with only the Lizards  OBrien was pinning all his hopes on the Dragonfly  I dont know what went on in the captains mind but he seemed more sympathetic towards OBrien now and when we met in the Club to discuss the situation he backed up OBriens idea of trying to reach Deucalionis Regio with the helicopter  It was a vague uncertain plan at the moment but it did offer some hope  The captain suggested setting up a way station in the Sinus Sabaeus area  If we succeeded in stocking a station so far out from base with provisions and fuel with the aid of the Dragonfly then at least two men would be able to get as far as Deucalionis Regio  There was nothing we could do but set to work again carefully estimating calculating deducing  I thought OBrien received the captains suggestion with a flicker of suppressed gratitude  We all knew how risky flight was in the Dragonfly and we all knew what a stickler for safety measures the captain was  OBrien was as well aware of it as any of us  A light wind rose again in the night and next morning the atmosphere was full of dust  Winding streams of fine sand were trickling down the dunes  Any experience we could get with Martian weather would come in useful when we set out on the great expedition later so we decided to stick to our programme in spite of the poor visibility  A group of eight men with two Lizards and fully loaded trailers set out from base for a full days test drive reconnoitring around the camp  It was led by OBrien and I was glad to be going along myself as relief driver on the Green Lizard  Visibility was not too bad but after we had been driving only half an hour never going at over 6 k p h  the base disappeared from sight completely  We had no communication problems with the control room at the moment  So here I was at last in the middle of the landscape of my former dreams  Maybe it yvas just a hopeless cruelly treacherous monotonous sea of dust but it was virgin territory and the idea excited me  I could understand what drove the seamen of old days into uncharted oceans what kept explorers going when worn down by sickness they pushed on into the interior of unknown continents       Suddenly the terrain altered  The dunes were lower and consisted of fine sand mingled with stones  Ground visibility improved too  There was no fine dust drifting in the light wind here  The geological group took mineral samples  And after three hours journey through the monotonous stony desert we saw the dark outlines of rocky cliffs rising against the grey background of the dusty horizon  In the dim light they looked huge aweinspiringand very far away  The slope leading up to them was not all that steep but it was covered by boulders and debris  We couldnt drive any further so we decided to continue on foot  Much to our surprise it was only a few minutes before we reached the cliffs  The rocks that looked so huge and far away were no more than twenty metres high  In my earphones I heard the excited remarks of the geologists from which I gathered that the journey had paid off for them  There was one rock formation in the shape of a ru- ined arch we guessed it was about three hundred metres long  We adopted it as an orientation point and named it Ghost Mountain from our first impressions of it  It was obviously the remains of an ancient crater  The view from the top of these fissured crags was one of sombre beauty  The sun almost directly overhead shone through the yellowish grey haze glowing dully on the red-brown rock of the cliffs  The diffused fight softened the darkness of the shadows in the deep clefts and the whole scene looked like a picture painted in pastel colours  Contact with base was still excellent and as we had no problems with our equipment and there were more than enough chemicals in reserve to top up the oxygen packs OBrien and the captain agreed that we would devote the whole day to exploring Ghost Mountain  The geologists certainly made a good haul but as OBrien put his samples in the box destined for laboratory work he muttered something about a sterile desert again  Visibility began to deteriorate about three in the afternoon and Jenkins back at base told us the wind was rising  So we decided to go back at once  As we drove between dunes of fine sand visibility got so bad that we lost sight of each other once we were over ten metres apart  We couldnt drive in the tracks we had left on the outward journey of course they were covered with dust by now  Thanks to the radio direction finder system there were no orientation difficulties but we did have trouble with the trailers  We kept running into dust drifts on the sides of the dunes away from the wind reversing with the trailers was a tricky business and both men on the trailer concerned had to help  We all took turns relieving each other but our first full days field work left us completely exhausted  To me the most valuable experience of that day was the realisation that the untouched majestic desert around us was not after all invincible  We were confined to base for the next eleven days  The wind was continuous covering the sky with a heavy cloud of dust and scattering fine sand over our camp  We had trouble keeping the access to the power plant clear and the dust filters of the plant itself were the bane of our lives  The meteorological instruments did have reliable and hermetically sealed mechanisms but Morphy could not rest without convincing himself daily that all his instruments were still working  By the captains orders if he went out he had to attach himself to a rope with a sliding latch hook  The captain was not being over-cautious in this sort of weather you need only stumble or let go of the rope to be lost for ever in the dust storm  From studying the readings taken so far Morphy had established traces of certain natural laws concerning the movement of the atmosphere and deviations in its pressure  Actually these were the same as terrestrial laws but much influenced by the specific conditions of Mars  Circulation is a far simpler matter in the Martian atmosphere which lacks any of the extensive water surfaces of Earth but there are still many other factors as yet not investigated which influence its movement  Morphy could already forecast strong winds pretty accurately which was important especially for the Dragonfly  While the weather kept us all at base we ventured to make only one small test drive outside under conditions we might well have to face during the Great March  Two Lizards with trailers as under normal conditions with an eight-man crew went for a drive of several hours near the base  All the men had safety ropes to keep them fastened to the tractors for visibility was down to a few metres  The men were in constant communication with the control room  The experiment was successful although the pace of the march in weather like this was not very encouraging and we found a deficiency in our equipmentone which we should have to be careful not to underestimate  The transparent panels in the visors of our helmets became blurred by the constant onslaught of grains of sand the material used was very hard able to stand up to scratches but we could just imagine what a state it would get into after several days in the open  So the polishing pastes provided by the project were not an over-imaginative detail we should need to have them ready to hand in an expedition of any length  By now a precise plan had been worked out for reaching the Deucalionis Regio area with the help of the Dragonfly  Taking into account the helicopters capacity Lawrenson calculated that it would take at least twenty flights to set up a way station for four men in the Sinus Sabaeus area  If only one man went on each flight the number would be reduced by one-thirdsay fourteen flights  However the captain flatly vetoed any suggestion of a one-man crew so we were stuck with twenty flights to establish a base half way to Deucalionis Regio  In good weather we could make three flights a day  Then there would be something over three hundred kilometres still to go from this base to Deucalionis Regio  Two or three flights from the halfway house would be good enough to set up another base in Deucalionis Regio itself where two men could stay for a short time  It seemed quite a good plan and OBriens energy infected everyone  When the wind died down and the dust in the atmosphere settled we saw the Astras white cabin glowing red among the dust dunes on the horizon  Using the telescope we could see that the whole undercarriage and the tracks were covered with dust  Williams asked if he could have another go at the controls of the Astra  Soon afterwards the Red Lizard set off with Williams and Sheldon on board and made its way through clouds of dust and sand to the mobile laboratory  All of us watching the scene from base were secretly hoping for some miracle or other but we were staggered when soon after we saw Williams get into the drivers cab the Astra began to move  She crept out of the dust dune like an animal waking from sleep and turned slowly towards base  Williams radioed to the control room that her engine had begun to turn over after a perfectly normal attempt to start it  Followed by the Red Lizard Williams arrived back at base with the Astra and drove up on the ramp of the garage so that she could be given a thorough examination  We might manage to discover the cause of the mysterious breakdown and then we could make two attacks on the fortress of Deucalionis Regio one by air and one by land  Williams found the cause of the breakdown the same day the safety button of the main fuel supply was not quite pushed injust a small oversight on the drivers part  I felt sure Williams had fought a hard battle with his conscience before he decided to explain the mystery but our faith in the vehicles reliability was more important than personal pride  The salvaging of the Astra had an unexpected result the captain indicated that if the Astra got through her tests satisfactorily he would not authorise a flight to Deucalionis Regio after all  OBrien who had put so much hope and effort into this plan lost his temper again and asked the captain how long he intended to go on frustrating the expeditions main objective  It was an unfortunate remark expressing all the bitterness that can only be felt by a man who sees his lifes work begin to collapse before his eyes  A very unfortunate remark in fact for OBrien had made it in front of McKinley Glennon and myself  I hoped he was going to apologise  What had become of his philosophical poise his sensitivity and tact He seemed to have become a completely different person  Perhaps we all alter if we become inhabitants of another planet Perhaps we even lose our humanity Or are the impulses that stir in us under the mask of civilisation our real human natures The captains pale face went paler still and he opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something but couldnt quite bring it out  In this painful silence we all trembled for the fate of the expedition  At last the captain said OBrien youre either ill or over-tired  Youd better get some rest  Then he went calmly on enumerating the risks of using the helicopter  I saw sweat standing out on his forehead  OBrien left the room in silence  When OBrien had gone I said something to try and clear the air but I knew I was deceiving myselfIve never been good at fine phrases  The captain seemed to want to help me and interrupted  Never mind all that Cosby he said  Were none of us sick  Unless as a psychiatrist you consider wounded vanity a sickness Horrified I realised that the captain when challenged reached for exactly the same weapons as OBrien  We spent a number of days making test drives near base with the Astra and we also did some deep drilling  The results gave the geologists a lot of scientifically valuable information but there were no revolutionary discoveries  There was nothing at all to confirm the old hypothesis of masses of ice under the layer of dust and sand in this part of the desert  The deep shafts we drilled produced only unusually heavy Aeolian sediments depositions caused by the wind mostly composed of silicates and red and yellow iron oxides  Where solid matter did emerge from the depositions of the wind we found only a scanty series of rocks partly covered with limonite strata  The Edom desert really was sterile so far as astrobiology was concerned  There were only dead desertsMoab Aeria Chrysefor thousands of kilometres to north east and west  No wonder the ease with which the Dragonfly could cross these bleak desolate plains kept OBrien awake at nights  But on the day when Lawrenson and McKinley took off to explore the terrain along our planned route all our hopes of using the helicopter were dashed  After an hours flight Lawrenson called back to say that the radio compass on board the Dragonfly had packed up  It was still clear weather but the captain gave the order for them to turn back at once  We were badly worried without reliable navigational in- struments the Dragonfly could easily lose her way in the monotonous country  Briggs sent up signal rockets at regular intervals  When the Dragonfly did land back at base Lawrenson said he could hardly believe his eyes when he saw the green flareshe hadnt expected to see them at that point on the horizon at all  If he had had to rely on his own judgment he would certainly have missed the base  Jenkins took the radio compass apart and tried to repair it  It was no good  And even if he had succeeded I believe the captain would not have given permission for the Dragonfly to take off on any more long flightswith good reason when instruments so vital to survival had proved unreliable  Lawrenson who was really in love with his helicopter was shattered  It was a severe blow for him and for the whole expedition  All we could do now was pin our hopes on the tractors and on human endurance  OBrien and the captain decided to go back to the original plan which meant reaching the Sinus Sabaeus region with the Astra and two Lizards and setting up a way station there for the Great March to Deucalionis Regio  The hundred-and-nineteenth day on Mars had a character all its own  The Astra stood ready to go with a fully loaded trailer twelve two-hundred-litre containers of fuel twelve insulated two-hundred-litre water containers crates of provisions and equipmentall together over two tons Mars weight  The trailers of the two Lizards were similarly loaded  Including the return journey the expedition had almost a thousand kilometres to go and the journey was planned to take sixty days  After consulting the captain OBrien picked ten men  The evening before the expedition set off the setting sun flooded the desert around the base with deep reddish-orange and violet colour  The sand and rocks looked like molten metal  Our spirits were high at the festive evening meal  Tomorrow the expedition split up  Who ought to be envying whom I was glad that I was in the group set- ting off on the journey but naturally no one put anything like that into words that evening  The captain and OBrien talked to each other as if there had never been any trouble between them  Captain Norton was staying at base while OBrien led the exploration party  They drank orange juice to the success of the expeditionthe juice of oranges ripened under the same sun that shone down here on the dead desolate wilderness  At that moment Im sure no one felt resentment of any kind  It was a solemn moment small ordinary things didnt seem to matter as if their size and significance had actually changed  But later when I was trying to get to sleep in my bunk I realised that our lives really consist of small ordinary things and their size and significance cannot change  CHAPTER 16 The frosty haze dispersed after sunrise  There was no wind at all  The tractors engines were started up at seven in the morning  We stood in a line beside the loaded vehicles waiting for the captains farewell speech  OBrien drew us up in strict military ordersince he set no store by such things himself I saw this as an expression of good will and respect for the captain  Our bright yellow spacesuits still free of dust shone in the sunlight as if we were on a ceremonial parade  Then the door of the pressure chamber opened  OBrien went to meet the captain and still observing military etiquette reported the column ready to start  We heard the captains answer in our earphones  Im sure we can do anything if we put our minds to it and all work together  He shook OBriens hand and turned to us  Good luck boys he said in his warmest voice  We got in  The engines which were warm by now revved up and the column set off  The dust we raised enveloped the base in a light haze  When I turned round on the seat of the Lizard to look back at the camp which I wouldnt be seeing again for two months I saw the captain standing on top of a sand dune legs apart watching us go  Nature loves the sort of coincidences into which the human imagination can read a special meaning and the sun hanging behind the captains head surrounded the dark silhouette of his figure with shimmering light  The first hours driving went exceptionally well  Nothing notable happened apart from some slight difficulties with the heavily loaded trailers  Our experience of test drives and reconnaissance expeditions near base came in very useful  So far we hadnt even got stuck in the dust and the policy of having one Lizard at the head of the column to test the ground deciding whether to drive on the coarse dark sand or the rocky ground where there were fewer drifts was a success too  I was second driver of the Green Lizard relieving Williams at hourly intervals  Everything was going according to plan one Lizard with her trailer in front behind her the Astra with the big trailer and bringing up the rear the second Lizard and trailer  The Lizards changed places every two hours  Everything seemed to be going well we were sticking to the plan of march the time schedule and the planned route  After two and a half hours drive a safety rope on the big tractor broke  Part of the load was loosened and slid off  OBrien asked who had fastened the rope and Sheldon and Radcliff owned up  Id never heard OBrien speak so sharply before  It reminded me how much anything that threatened his lifes work upset himand the aim of his lifes work was to touch traces of life on Mars with his own hand  We discovered that the rope had frayed against some containers which had worked loose  There was nothing for it but to reload the whole trailer which took us more than two hours and meant so much exertion that we had to give our hearts and lungs another hour to recuperate  OBrien was very much annoyed by the whole affair  I began to ask myself whether all the psychological insight I thought I had into the individual members of the expedition might not be just illusion or self-deception  Is a change in a mans physical makeup and environment enough to cause mental change Does he become better or worse because his body contains more salt or acid less oxygen or carbon dioxide is getting more light or darkness Ive always been fascinated by the thought that some day science will be able to improve the human characterand I shudder to think of science improving it in accordance with its own notions of how things should be  The fine weather held until after midday  The desert with the sun almost directly overhead shone in tints of gold contrasting sharply with the velvety depths of the dark sky  A monotonous but beautiful desert beautiful as the sea A desert elevated to the status of a terrifying monumentality  Not the least breath of wind stirred the waves of dust       But the brute force of our machines felt no emotion at the sight  They rolled on relentlessly crushing relics billions of years old turning them to meaningless rubble and covering them with dust the symbol of the past  This dust however was a reality and our worst enemy  It swirled under the caterpillars tracks like sinister smoke obscuring the view and covering both machines and men  Over millions of years in an exceptionally dry atmosphere the wind had ground it down so fine that a stone would sink into it as if into water  It was a malicious enemy lurking behind every dune and it scored twice against us that afternoon  When the Green Lizard at the head of the column stuck in a dust dune the driver of the Astra was not far enough back and she ran into the Lizards trailer in the cloud of dust it had raised  The convoy halted and we inspected the extent of the damage  The back of the trailer had been smashed in part of the load thrown off and two crates of provisions crushed and driven into the sand by the heavy tracks  Luckily the trailer could still go on  After this accident we doubled the distance between the vehicles  Not long afterwards we heard an order to stop through the earphones  Sheldon told us there was something wrong with the Astras engine  We were alarmed  Did this mean the end of the expedition In silence we gathered around Sheldon as he dismantled the air filter of the cooling system  OBrien did not get out of the cabin at all  I could imagine how he was feeling  Sheldon told us the red light monitoring engine temperature had begun to blink  Minutes of unbearable tension passed like an eternity  When Sheldon took out the filter lining and shook it it was dusty as a flour sack  We breathed again  Perhaps the clogged filter was the only cause of the overheated engine  Sheldon put in a new lining and we drove on nervously waiting for the next problem  The fiery red sun dipped into the violet haze above the horizon  We stood beside the tractors on the edge of a large crater silently watching the gripping ever moving spectacle that the sun acts out billions of times on the stages of its planets  We were tired and not at our best any more  We longed desperately for sleep  One after another we crawled into the Astras changing cabin to take off our heavy spacesuits  However at the end of the days march we still had to determine our exact position with the help of the radio mast  OBrien measured and drew in the line of intersection  According to his calculations we had come fifty-six kilometres  OBrien measured the distance back to base as the crow flies on the map twenty-five kilometres almost double the average daily distance we needed to cover yet only a tiny way on the map  The search for ground which we could drive over was taking us many kilometres out of our way  I could see OBrien marking off the distance and I wondered how we would get on if the weather changed for the worse       OBrien made a radio transmission back to base with a brief report of our days march  Sitting in the Astras air-conditioned cabin I heard his voice only faintly although he was sitting at the transmitter quite close to me  I had a vague feeling there were still several medical jobs I had to do but I didnt know what they were  I didnt mind  All I wanted to do was sleep sleep   I shook myself awake but all I could do was concentrate enough to hear the voices near me OBrien discussing the weather with Morphy back at base  It didnt seem to concern me   I fell into a deep sleep       I woke before midnight dripping with sweat  I felt it was far too close in the cabin with ten sleeping men  For a moment I dreamed of an open window with the fresh night air streaming in  But the porthole with its toughened glass by my head brought me back to reality  Through that glass I saw the desert in the faint silvery mother-of-pearl light of the Martian night  I tried to feel some kind of romantic appreciation of my dream which was now reality but I kept wondering whether the oxygen regenerators were working properly  If they werent I ought to be hearing acoustic signalsbut suppose the signals had broken down too Perhaps Id made a mistake in our drug dosage  Perhapsit was all perhaps and it didnt seem to matter  I fell asleep again it was like falling into a bottomless pit  CHAPTER 17 Next morning the sun was blazing down  At breakfast OBrien apologised to Sheldon and Radcliff for his sharpness yesterday  Neither of them knew what to say to thisin actual fact theyd admitted their share of responsibility for the accident and they didnt want to slither out of it  However that wasnt what OBrien was thinking of if I understood him correctly he did not want to use methods of command of which he personally disapproved  He was poised and friendly once more harder on himself than on othersin fact he looked like the picture I used to have of him again  But to my own surprise I realised there was something different about that picture now  I didnt know quite what  It was like seeing a portrait to which a chance stroke of the brush has given a strangely disturbing expression  And I realised too that we all altered to some extent as soon as our bodies were encased in their heavy spacesuits  I remembered sitting on the tractor with Williams all day yesterday with no sense of companionship  Yet Williams was not only my companion but one of my best friends  I thought that the helmet enclosing the entire face and the fact that technological expertise had reduced the necessity for communication to a minimum meant we had no outlet for our emotions  We couldnt see each others faces or the expression of the eyes and we were missing out on ordinary everyday conversation too  Otherwise everything was going very smoothly  The engines started without a hitch although they had been freezing overnight  We were all in better spirits after our rest and convinced that we should succeed in reaching the Sinus Sabaeus region  OBrien had infect- ed us all with his longing to reach our objective far to the south to see something other than this endless ocean of dust and rocksas if we could hope to find anything but dust and rocks on this planet Perhaps an oasis with picturesque Martian plants growing in it and unknown wonderful creatures moving or flying about      well naturally we were not so simple as all that  The unmanned probes sent to Mars had told us exactly what to expect and how few life forms science hoped to find here  Yet each of us cherished some of that secret irrational romanticism that will overstep the bounds of probability  After all dreams are essential for the progress of sciencethe most serious of scientific hypotheses is really nothing but a dream  At midday we got a fix on our position  We were almost sixty kilometres from base as the crow flies  This was fantastic  In four hours wed come further than all day yesterday We were tired but we cut our midday rest to a minimum  OBrien radioed back and asked to speak to Morphy to discuss the weather though who knew anything much about the incalculable weather conditions here Morphy could tell us only what we could see for ourselves the sun was shining and it was perfectly still  The sun shone until evening  Eighty-two kilometres from base as the crow flies  The vehicles engines switched off looked like tired animals resting on the soft sand in the evening dusk  Frosty veils of mist shimmered high above the western horizon  After midnight the mist sank to earth covering the desert with a very thin film of carbon dioxide hoarfrost  In the morning the sun was shining again and by the time we set off frost still lay only in the shadows of the craters  What would this day bring Before noon we had gone a hundred kilometres from base  We had been on the march two and a half days and we had almost a third of the distance separating us from Sinus Sabaeus behind us  It was incredible By evening we had made it another twenty-one kilometres  Communications with base were excellent  Tired as we were we were delighted that things were going so well and almost everyone wanted to talk to base which was becoming more and more like home to us as the kilometre count grew  I detected the cordiality of their former friendship in the conversation between OBrien and the captain  McKinley sent a message back to base too  Will someone tell Mission Control Id like some instructions from the boys back there on how to work a drill at a run This witticism almost spoiled the eveningOBrien saw it as a mild reproach to himself for not giving McKinley enough opportunities for geological research  I had the impression OBrien was positively allergic to anything that seemed to threaten his own scientific aims in the very slightest  McKinley had some trouble convincing him that he hadnt meant anything of the kind  Obviously the lack of any normal private life is a great drawback to expeditions such as ours highly equipped from the technological point of view  Private conversations were impossible during our rest periods in the air-conditioned cabin where the designers had naturally economised on space and of course while we were out on the surface we could talk only by radio  The success of a space shot may depend considerably on good teamwork from its members but Im still sure that this lack of any private life is a real disadvantage  I lay down to sleep feeling that neither good weather nor technology could guarantee success  On the fourth day the sun was still shining  The desert looked so much the same that we felt as though we were going round and round in circles  Then the Red Lizard heading the column stuck in flowing dust  This time we had to unhitch the trailer and pull it out with the help of the Green Lizard  And then as we were trying to skirt around the spot the Astra stuck too  It was all so unexpected that we stood as if paralyzed gazing at the motionless vehicle in the swirling dust that hung like grey mist in the still atmosphere  We disconnected the big trailer and the Lizards two smaller trailers hooked on the ropes and waited in suspense  The Lizards suddenly looked very tiny would they manage to get the Astra out The engines of all three vehicles roared and everything disappeared in dust  When the clouds of dust settled we saw that the Astra had sunk in still deeper  It had been a mistake to use her engine she had simply burrowed her way deeper into the dust like a gigantic mole  After a while we realised that the Lizards were never going to shift the heavy vehicle on their own  In the still atmosphere the dust gradually sank to the ground and the indifferent sun shone down on the desert  All we could do now was dig a deep trench behind the Astra so that she could reverse her way out  Half an hours hard labour in our heavy spacesuits showed us that it was going to take at least four hours to dig the trench the fine dust kept trickling down into it again  Briggs sank in up to his chest and if we hadnt thrown him a rope at once he would have disappeared entirely  The dust we raised filtered the sunlight and decreased visibility to a few metres  The temperature inside our suits rose the sweat was an appalling nuisance and our lungs struggled desperately for air  At midday the trench was finished and though we could hardly stand upright we all held our breath as we waited to see if the vehicle could get out  After several unsuccessful attempts the Astra was half buried in dust again  Totally exhausted we sank to the ground  After a dismal midday mealthe water we drank was the best part of itwe discussed the rescue operation and how to go on with it  We would work in two shifts digging the dust away and we would go slowly so as not to tire ourselves out  Wed hang on even if it took us several days  It was not a matter of time now the question was whether we could salvage the Astra  An hour after sunset the Astra drove out of the pit which might have been her grave  Luckily we found coarser material three metres down and the tracks did not burrow into it  We were immensely relieved  Lying on our bunks in the air-conditioned cabin utterly worn out but freed from our spacesuits and feeling that our bodies were wonderfully light we realised very forcibly how much the Astra meant to an expedition out on the surface of Mars  The total gain we recorded that day was only five kilometres  Billions of grains of dust and sand basked in the sun lying at rest  The column made slow progress we were worried about dust swamps after yesterday  We made bigger and bigger detours around suspect spots  We drove a long way but the midday readings told us we were really only nine kilometres further from base  The afternoon was even worse  We were obviously entering a region contaminated by flowing dust  The progress of the column was so slow that OBrien began to lose his composure  As we were laboriously searching for firm ground in the Green Lizard we heard OBriens voice in our earphones telling us not to get neurotic about dust  Williams who happened to be driving stopped and with a silent gesture asked me to take over  I realised he felt bitter and I was almost pleased myself when we stuck again quarter of an hour later and had to unhitch the trailer  I felt hurt by OBriens remark too  Our balance sheet didnt look too good at the end of that days march  We had covered eighty-two kilometres but our net gain was eleven  OBrien and McKinley sat for a long time studying the aerial photographs of the region through which our route lay trying to judge from the look of it what the going would be like  With what success we found out next day when we nearly buried the Astra  The land ahead was so dusty that all we could do was go quite a long way back and try to drive round the swamp in a detour to the east  Our convoy dragged itself laboriously along wandering hither and thither going back stopping going on again  The desert was endless monotonousand time was running out  Little of our early enthusiasm was left we all felt dulled by weariness  At the end of the sixth day we found that the great belt of dust drifts we had reached ran north  After getting a fix on our position we recorded sadly that we had driven eighty-two kilometres that day and we were further from Sinus Sabaeus than when we started  Our detour was taking us too far east  After a long study of the map OBrien who was saying less and less decided to go back to the previous days point of departure and make a detour to the west around the dust belt  As if to mock our slow crawling progress the still sunny weather held with no sign of a change  On the seventh day originally planned as a rest day we made up the previous days loss  On the eighth and ninth days of our march the dust belt forced us far to the west but it was easier driving now and the aerial maps gave us hope  The weather was still good the vehicles were in good working orderit was just the humans who were at the end of their tether and the tenth day had to be given up to rest  Our campif the group of tractors and trailers can be so calledwas on a flat rocky plateau partly drifted over with fine sand with several large boulders sticking out of it  The red-brown stone shone as if it were lacquered  That evening as the rocks glowed in the light of the setting sun we had no idea what a lucky chance it was that had brought us to this plateauor what a certain piece of eroded rock was going to mean to one of us  We slept until about midday all but OBrien who had been sitting over his maps since nine oclock  His temper seemed to be fraying again  I thought odd as it might seem that the fine weather was the main reason ten of the thirty days allowed for us to reach Sinus Sabaeus were over and we were still a long way off  OBriens last radio transmission to the captain had been rather tense  He complained that the tractors were making slow progress thus causing the crew a lot of trouble while the Dragonfly was not being used to the full and returned to his plan of reaching Deu- calionis Regio with the aid of the helicopter  The last few days had shown that the weather was not nearly so dangerous for flying as it had seemed  At that moment we all agreed with OBrien  From the captains answer we gathered that his conscience was pricking him a bit about the Dragonfly  He obviously felt the need to appeal to some neutral authority and suggested discussing it with Mission Control who hadnt sanctioned the use of the Dragonfly for long-distance flights anyway  What do they know about conditions here asked OBrien angrily  Bureaucrats The conversation ended with ill feeling on both sides  Late that afternoon we had another transmission from base  The captain agreed to use the Dragonfly if the going did not improve considerably next day  Good weather was a prerequisite of course  We had had a good rest and this news raised our spirits  From my bunk I could see the desert red in the light of the low sun through the porthole  It was a vision of sublime stillness and lofty calm it filled me with a sense of peace  Then a shout woke me  I couldnt make out what was going on  It was dark inside the cabin  When I came to my senses properly I realised there was someone walking up and down among the bunks waking us up  I recognised his voiceit was Compton and he was telling us something confused about a blue light  What sort of hallucinations were we having now Perhaps he was dreaming or walking in his sleepbut then I noticed strange flickering blue lights on the cabin roof myself  I turned to the porthole and looked out  I froze with astonishment  The dark shape of one of the Lizards standing in the sand not far off was covered with flickering little blue flames as if someone had stuck blue candles all over it and I saw flashes of light above the horizon  There was confusion in the cabin once the bunks were let down we could hardly move about  Everyone was crowding around the portholes on the north-east side  Excitement rose when a shining bright violet ball appeared on the crest of a dust dune slowly floating towards us over the ridges of the land  Fascinated we watched its zigzag course  It was gathering speed as it leaped over the hollows  Involuntarily we flinched back from the windows as the ball of light made straight for us at tremendous speed  A blinding light filled the cabin  I felt as though the fiery ball had touched the toughened glass of the porthole I thought I heard the crackling of electric explosions  Then the ball disappeared and we heard pattering sounds on the roof of the vehicle  I dont knownone of us knewhow many seconds we waited in suspense  Then the flaming light leaped up on one of the Lizards  The little blue lights went out at once the ball shone more brightly than ever and vanished as suddenly as it had come  We were all much excited by this strange phenomenon reminiscent of ball lightning  OBrien switched on the transmitter and tried in vain to reach base all we could hear was a constant crackle of static  OBrien told us all to be ready  We got into our spacesuits and went outside to make sure the trailer loads were securely fastened down  The stars in the north-east sky gradually went out and we heard a rushing like a huge distant waterfall  OBrien wanted to move one of the small tractors but the rushing noise grew louder so fast that he countermanded the order  We hurried back to the cabin of the Astra as fast as we could  After the experiences wed already had it was not wise to stay outside a safe shelteror was it safe The first onslaught of the dust storm was so violent that the cabin shook  I was afraid the heavy vehicle would tip over  The roaring of the wind carrying whole mountains of dust was deafening  I felt utterly helpless  The cabin of the Astra swayed and rocked and the metal screeched as if it felt pain as the sand whipped against it  The powers of the human mind are vast but at those moments when Nature really shows her fist all we can do is wait hope and fear  CHAPTER 18 At seven in the morning there was impenetrable dark outside  The cabin was shaken the whole time by the raging wind  We lay there helpless waiting       The windows were drifted up on the windward side  Were we fated to be buried alive in the dust after all Judging by the shaking of the cabin the Astra was not quite covered yet  The appalling constant roar of the storm hurt the backs of our heads  We lost our sense of time  Everything merged into a single fiery deafening pain  The chronometer showed that it was midday but it was pitch dark outside  The skylight in the roof was not covered yet we pushed the hatch back and in the electric light we saw muddy streams of sand and dust swirling above the glass overhead  OBrien switched on the radio equipment  The receivers were silent  Towards the end of the day the raging storm slackened slightly and the cabin stopped swaying  We discussed the situation so far as we could make ourselves heard in the deafening din  We had to find out what had happened to the trailer loads how large the dust drifts were and what state the Lizards were in but in this weather it would be risky to leave the cabin even on a rope  McKinley Williams and Briggs who were the strongest of us at the time volunteered but OBrien refused their offer saying that mere information would be no use and they couldnt possibly actually do anything  Towards midnight the storm slackened off some more it now sounded like the rushing of a river  OBrien succeeded in making radio contact with base  There was a lot of disturbance and we lost most of the conversation but we did get the news that the dust storm had descended on the base too and they were worried about us  OBriens report was rather rosier than the reality  After the conversation with base our spirits liftedthe nagging feeling that we were cut off from the world and from other men was gone  OBrien was willing to let us try to find out the situation outside now  But McKinley came back from the pressure chamber at once the sliding door would not budge  The vehicle was obviously drifted over with dust and we were prisoners  This was an almost disastrous situation  If we couldnt free ourselves by our own efforts time was our worst enemy  Most of the chemicals for the oxygen regenerators were divided out among the trailers to reduce the risk of loss as far as possible  The oxygen system could keep life going in the fully occupied cabin for a maximum of a hundred hours  A rescue expedition from base couldnt fight its way through to us for six days at the earliest always provided they could even find the camp in the dust drifts which was unlikely even in perfect weather  It was even less likely that the helicopter could spot us  I felt that we were wasting valuable air with every breath we drew  We were about to face something we had practised overcoming for years during our training fear of running out of oxygen  I could feel that fear like a cold claw on the back of my neck  Sweat dripped from my forehead and I was overcome by a feeling of shame  I stood naked before my analytical mind which whispered scornfully you see youre just an ordinary living creature  I groped confusedly for the one certainty Id believed would always help me the natural inevitability of death  Well now youre facing this natural inevitability of yours said my brain to me  So come to terms with it To my shame I must admit that I couldnt  We struggled in vain to open the door  OBrien suggested using the Astras engine to help free her  A new hope The engine was started and after a few endless moments we felt shuddering sensations underfoot  Sheldon came out of the drivers cab  Youd better know that Im risking ruining the engine he said  Do I go on No leave it alone said OBrien who had been silent until now  Its no good getting hysterical  We have to get out of this hole on our own we all know that  I suggest we dont report the situation back to base  Any attempt to help us would be risky and pointless  We all knew that our friends at base would want to come and help us even against our will so we agreed with OBrien  That meant that we had a hundred hours of hope left and every moment was of priceless value now  It was disturbing to think of the roof of our prison getting thicker every minute  When time is running out like water from a breach in a dam its hard to think coolly  But how had we come to overlook one very important factor We could hear the howling of the wind so the Astra couldnt be completely buried Once again we tried to move the sliding door  McKinley and Sheldon shut themselves into the pressure cabin and tried to clear the doorway by banging it  Then they took out one of the folding seats and battered the door with that  Just as we were wondering whether to unscrew the skylight even at the risk of endangering the airlock we heard a shout from the pressure chamber audible even above the howling of the wind  The door had moved By morning the doorway was clear  All next dayit was day only according to the chronometer for it was not much lighter than night we shovelled dust away from the Astras doorway while the storm still went on  Although we were on safety ropes there was always the danger that someone might collapse from exhaustion and be buried in the dust  We formed two shifts to relieve each other and kept in constant radio contact  We had to give names every time we called to make exact monitoring of our positions possible but towards midday we were reacting very slowly  OBrien had to call my name several times before I realised that I ought to answer  It cost me a great effort  I felt an almost uncontrollable desire to lie down on the ground give myself up to the bliss of not moving and just go to sleep  Alarm shook us out of our lethargy  McKinley wasnt answering Had he fallen asleep or lost consciousness We groped our way along the rope and shouted into the microphonebut the rope was slack and McKinley did not answer  How could such an experienced man have left the rope in this weather Had his judgment failed him We systematically searched the area around us but there was nothing to be found within reach of the rope  We extended it  We were tormented by the idea that the dust storm could have buried its first human victim just a few metres away from us  After a couple of hours desperate search we finally found McKinley  He was standing with his back to a boulder half covered in dust  Later we learned how the accident had happened  As he worked McKinley got entangled in the safety rope and so as not to have to turn and unwind himself he undid the hook and tried to shake the rope off his foot  As he did so he fell on his back  He crawled around in the dust feeling for the rope but when he got up a gust of wind flung him down again and in the darkness he lost his sense of direction  Afraid of being buried by the dust storm he decided to walk in a circle hoping to bump into the Astra or one of the small tractors  He called for help but his radio set was dead it had been damaged by his fall  When the storm and chance brought him up against the rock he did the most sensible fhing he could he leaned his back against his one solid point of reference and did not move from the spot  The storm raged all night covering the camp with new dust drifts  We had to work hard to keep the doorway of the cabin clear  It all seemed like some dreadful exhausting dream from which we could not wake  We lost all power of consecutive thought nothing was left but the battle with our wills which wanted to give in surrender fall down and sleepsleep perhaps for ever  As morning came the storm was so much gentler that we could venture to stop fighting the dust crawl into the cabin eat a proper mealand sleep  While the daylight filtered dimly through the clouds of dust carried on the whistling wind we floated dreamlessly in blissful unconsciousness for a full twenty-four hours  When we woke the wind was still howling  It was the fourteenth day of our march  All day long in the dim light we shovelled dust away from the tractors and trailers  Towards evening we managed to dig out the overturned trailer of the Green Lizard  The wind had scattered its load and buried it under the dust where it would become part of the geological stratum turning gradually to a tiny line in the book of the past perhaps a completely meaningless line in the history of the planet Mars  But for us it meant the loss of one-third of our supplies of water and oxygen  On the fifteenth day the weather was no better  A strong north-east wind drove constant clouds of dust and fine sand over our camp  We could hardly see ten metres ahead of us  We spoke to them at base where things were just the same  The captain did not want us to go on  He suggested a return to base if the situation did not improve within three days but OBrien would not hear of it  Morale among the exhausted crew was well below zero  On the sixteenth and seventeenth days we went on struggling with the wind and the dust  A dismal thought occurred to us if the winds that blew in this zone for almost the whole of the Martian summer were as strong as this our scientific mission was as good as done for  OBrien didnt talk about it  None of us talked about it  On the eighteenth day the wind was a lot gentler and at last we could rest all day  OBrien spoke to base that evening  After some hesitation the captain agreed to another attempt to go south but on one condition as soon as the weather got worse we must stop the march and return to base  OBrien did not seem to have heard him  CHAPTER 19 Next morning our column of tractors left the plateau which had almost been our tomb  The wind meant that visibility was down to twelve metres at most  According to the map we expected to find passable country to the south and after two hours journey we met with the first pleasant surprise we had had on this planet the caterpillar tracks were not raising dust any more  We were crossing rough friable ground  The land stretching ahead into the dust haze was almost completely level with just a few craters here and there  The engines were going all out and our mood of depression swung back to one of wild optimism  For some mysterious reason we were subject to extreme changes of mood on Mars in this environment a man might just as easily feel either smothering depression or intoxicating euphoria  I thought these fluctuations of mood depended far more on material conditions here than on Earth  From a medical standpoint and by terrestrial standards we could no longer be described as normal and I think these different standards must be taken into account in judging the individual members of the expedition and the way they acted  Towards the end of the days journey we recorded another net gain of forty-eight kilometres  Three more days like that and we would be at our journeys end  But the next day was not like that at all  The change began in the morning  Since the wind had died down completely overnight and the dust haze had vanished from the atmosphere for unknown reasons we could see the sunrise for the first time in many days  Only it was like no sunrise we had seen before  The sun was almost purple hanging in the middle of a sulphur yellow circle which was greenish at the edge and contained four more pale orange suns  As we observed this strange phenomenon with amazement small silvery needles of ice fell from the starry sky drifting slowly down and vaporising the moment they touched the dust  It was an incredibly beautiful sight  Then we tried to start up the Green Lizard  Nothing happened  And with that hard reality took hold of us again  Williams and Briggs in their clumsy gloves worked for over three hours to repair the fault  The fuel supply was completely stopped up  When we finally set off again we had gone only a few metres when a bolt broke off one of the swing arms of the big trailer  The vehicle was lying on its side and we could only replace the bolt if we took half the load off it  We didnt really want to heave the heavy crates and containers off so we tried to jack the trailer up and Williams shoved a piece of rock under the footplate of the jack to stop it driving itself into the ground  As he was kneeling under the trailer putting in the new bolt the piece of rock broke under the pressure bearing down on it the swing arm came crashing down and crushed Williamss right arm against the undercarriage  We heard a dreadful cry of pain in our earphones then he collapsed unconscious  I cant say how many endless minutes it took us to free Williamss hand with the help of the jack  Then we carried his limp body to the cabin as quickly as possible  Over the western horizon a wall of dust clouds lit up by the sun began to rise menacingly  Back in the cabin I found that Williams had completely crushed the thumb of his right hand and all his fingers were badly bruised  The sight of the hand was upsetting even to a doctor  His spacesuit had been damaged so he had also suffered severe shock  I treated him as best I could in the circumstances and radioed back to base  Watts and I discussed the situation and we decided to amputate the top joint of the thumb  Ill admit that at that moment Id willingly have given up my place in the expedition to Watts surgery had never been my favourite field  Towards evening Williams came round enough to say a word or so  Listen he gasped painfully  Youre not to turn back because of menot to       I shall never forget the moment when OBrien bent over the injured man put his hand on his shoulder and moved his lips several times as if he wanted to say something very difficult  But nothing came out and Williams who was weak from loss of blood lost consciousness again  OBrien reported the accident back to base and asked the captain to send the Dragonfly  If the weather was too bad for the helicopter to take off we should have to return to base with the injured Williams  Another strong wind rose that night and Williams said he didnt feel at all bad  But I didnt like his exaggerated optimism  I suspected he was just putting it on  Again OBrien said nothing  In the interests of Williamss mental welfare wed agreed not to tell him that we were turning back  The truth is not always the best way  We were all surprised when OBrien said to him out of the blue Look here Henry it occurs to me you just might come to feel the failure of this expedition was your fault  Pure nonsense of coursethe same thing LUDEK PESEK 128 might happen to me tomorrow and then it would be my faulteven more so as Im the leader  I am responsible for the life of every man in this team and Im telling you as straight as I can you can stop acting the hero and tell me how you really feel Williams tried to pretend he didnt know what OBrien was talking about but soon he gave in  Oh all right he said  I feel like death but not so bad that you all have to go back because of me  Either I fly back to base in the helicopter or I go on with you  South  Whats the difference between the cabin of the Astra and the camp at base I couldnt bear to think youd had to turn back because of me       Leaning over him OBrien said softly Henry you have no idea how grateful Id be to you if you could wait five days perhaps only four or even three       You keep going Williams repeated firmly  Keep going south  About midday the force of the wind slackened slightly  OBrien called back to base reported the change in the weather and said that by Williamss own wish we were going on with our journey  The captain was furious and said the decision was none of Williamss business  He told OBrien to wait where we were for another twenty-four hours to see if the weather improved enough for the Dragonfly to take off  OBrien said that was just a pointless waste of timeit couldnt matter if the helicopter had to fly thirty or forty kilometres further  Annoyed by his obstinacy the captain called his second-in-command an ambitious careerist  Im not ambitious replied OBrien angrily  If thats the way you see it we just dont have any point of contact  Then he broke off the transmission and told the team to get ready to start  We set off again within the hourgoing south  For the first time OBrien was openly defying the captain  As we expected from the map the character of the ground changed  We were crunching over rough stones now instead of dust dunes  Visibility was poor until evening so we could not get much idea of the country around us  The view in the hazy distance was all the more striking  The rust-coloured ridge of a low highland area gleamed ahead on the south-east horizon  If the weather held we could get there in two days  The column went on without difficulty until the middle of the day  Still no dust dunes only rough ground pitted with craters which we had to avoid  Morale would have been high but for the fact that Williams was lying on his bunk in the jolting cabin of the Astra  His condition worried me he had a high temperature and was in great pain  When I changed his blood-soaked bandage at midday I was alarmed by the swelling of his hand  The blue bruises had turned black in places  I consulted Watts back at base at once and he advised me to think it over carefully and not hesitate to amputate the rest of the thumb if necessary  This of course meant that we stayed where we were until evening when the captain sent another radio message asking OBrien to turn back  It struck me that he was being very careful not to phrase his request as a direct order perhaps to avoid losing face if OBrien did not obey perhaps to shield OBrien himself from the consequences of disobeying an order  OBrien said he refused to cancel out the superhuman efforts made by the whole teamwe just couldnt give up only a few kilometres from our journeys end  And he laid emphasis on his responsibility for the scientific mission  As for Williams he asked the captain to send the Dragonfly and the captain understandably refused to sanction such a long flight in hazy weather without properly functioning navigational instruments   it was a distressing conversation and I was glad when Williams fell into a deep sleep and so did not hear it all  Next morning Williams felt a lot better and the swelling had gone down so we went on  The weather had cleared again and I kept thinking of the helicopter  I thought the captain was being over-cautious  In the thin atmosphere the low hills seemed to lie within arms reach  The red-brown rocks furrowed by corrosion reared up from the scree slopes like the ramparts of some ancient city  In some alarm we wondered whether this impassable rock formation which we christened the Barrier would cut off our way to Sinus Sabaeus  According to the map there ought to be a circular shallow depression dividing the ridge of the highlands and towards midday we actually saw the hollow ahead  But the closer we came the worse our fears grew  An assessment of the terrain from aerial photographs was simply not enough  The depression in the ground turned out to be a huge chaotic tract of country broken by a great many hills scree slopes and dust drifts with fissured rocks sticking out of them  All we could do was turn aside to the south-west  The Astra swayed clumsily over the difficult ground  It was getting clearer all the time that there was something inhuman about OBriens scientific enthusiasm  Williams must be suffering the torments of hell in his bunk  I couldnt allow it any longer I reminded OBrien of the injured man  Ask the captain to send the helicopter for him then said OBrien  Thats the only thing to do in this weather  We ended the days march in low spirits  Our detour to the south-west had brought us no nearer our goal and that evenings radio conversation with base was not cheering  The captain said the barometer was falling and refused to allow the Dragonfly to take off  Sure enough a wind rose in the night and raged about the cabin of the Astra shaking it to and fro until morning  In spite of the strong wind we went on next day  Visibility was not nearly so bad as in the dust deserts there were only rocks around us nothing but a jagged rubble of broken boulders  The sky dark violet and full of stars in clear weather was now covered by a dull yellow canopy of dust through which a ghostly sun shone down  The rock formation kept forcing us south-west  The entire Barrier was no more than two hundred metres high but it was quite impassable at least for the heavy Astra  OBrien considered the possibility of getting across it with the small tractors  At noon we found ourselves on rocky rising ground with a group of rocks ahead which looked like the fallen battlements of the Biblical Mount Sion  Guided by the map we prepared for the deciding attempt  We did not know that a counter-attack was already lying in wait that it had been brewing up over many days in the shape of a small microscopic insignificant thing which had been gnawing busily at atoms of steel  Just at the moment when on the twenty-fourth day of our journey a few minutes after fourteen hours Mars Time we revved up the Astras engine the steel axle broke and with one single pitiless jerk the engine stopped  A raging wind tore at the heavy bodywork of the Astra its painted splendour already almost scoured away as if impatient to play with its new toy or see if there was still a spark of life left in it  But the machine was quite dead  The wind howled furiously tearing at the rocks covering everything with dust  CHAPTER 20 We spent seven miserable days on that stony hill below the rocky battlements of Sion  The wind rose to a storm and dust stifled the daylight  The Astra with her cabin holding the ten-man crew kept rocking and swaying harder all the time  Williams groaned in delirium raving about water  Our one comfort was the fact that there was no need to clear away sand and dust we were on the side of the hill away from the wind and the dust and sand raised by the storm was flung away over the rocky ridge  We had lost contact with base for three days now  We spent our time lying down but it could hardly be said we relaxed  We were afraid of running out of air and water  We had been stuck here for seven days  Suppose another seven days like that followed or twenty or a hundred Suddenly the wind died down  The unnatural silence seemed to hum in our aching ears  Williams woke up bathed in sweat stared into empty space and when asked if he wanted a drink replied that death wasnt as bad as hed thought  Peace at last he sighed  His temperature was quite low now and I decided on drastic treatment  I slapped both sides of his face several times  Pull yourself together Henry I shouted  You mustnt let your mind wander  Its the wind thats stoppedfor Gods sake pull yourself together He looked at me blankly at first then smiled guiltily and apologised  OBrien reported back to base now that contact was restored that he was leaving Williams here with me to rest for a few days while he went on to try and find a way across the hilly country with the small tractors  The captain hesitated to agree but again I noticed that he did not want to try enforcing his authority in the face of OBriens inflexibility  He turned to a new plan which theyd been working out at base and which offered real hope of reaching Deucalionis Regio within fifty days for certain using the four small Lizards the Dragonfly and a chain of way stations set up in advance  Every days journey would provide a safe touchdown point for the Dragonfly  The captains tactics seemed to be to break the back of OBriens stubborn opposition  The argument ended in a compromise with the captain conceding more than OBrien  Our expedition would undertake brief sorties of exploration into the country around the Barrier over the next three days with the Astra acting as base  The same morning OBrien had part of the supplieschemicals for the oxygen regenerators water and fuelunloaded from the big trailer and put on the small ones and soon after midday two Lizards set off with a crew of eight men  I stood on the stony ground outside the motionless Astra watching with mixed feelings as the vehicles left in a cloud of dust  I could hear the crews voices in my earphones from time to time  I watched my companions until they disappeared behind a ridge  Once the human voices had died away a strange disturbing silence seemed to press in upon me  There was not a breath of wind the sky hung shapeless and colourless over the bleak landscape like a dirty awning  I turned back to the Astra to go into the pressure chamber and take off my heavy spacesuit  Just as I put my foot on the steps I saw something move behind the vehicle at the top of a crag a boulder that toppled slowly down the small slope taking great leaps and came to a halt in the debris below  How long had the preparation been for those few seconds action when the boulder broke loose from its parent rock How long had wind frost and the heat of the sun gnawed at that heavy shapeless mass before they split it off and endowed it with change and movement I realised that this was all natural nothing out of the ordinary had happened  The harmony of the universe of which 1 was a part was not disturbed by my presence  I belonged here now just as naturally as I would not be here in a hundred years time  Just as naturally as these rock walls would crumble away after billions of years in the heat of the ageing sun with no feeling for mankind long forgotten by then  While somewhere or other on a planet hardly cool enough yet for water to come into being some slight primeval vestiges of life would be indicating that some day grass or a tree or a horse a bird or a man might exist  Henry Williams was asleep when I went into the cabin  I sat down by one of the windows and watched time go by into the silence  As evening came on I managed to make radio contact with one of the Lizards using a weak transmitter  I learned that the expedition had pitched camp in the rocks at the foot of the Barrier  According to McKinley the slope which they hoped to climb next day was not too steep but had a great many craters partly buried in drifts of dust and sand  He thought that originally this hilly country had not been drifted over with dust it was very reminiscent of the rock formations we knew from the moon  I felt anxious about next day  Later I was in contact with base again and the captain asked after Williams  I didnt try to hide anything but I felt that the captain did not quite believe me  He told me that Lawrenson was prepared to risk his life to fly here with the Dragonfly and take Williams back to base  If the wounded mans condition required it he would give his permission  So now it was up to me  Ive never been particularly good at making quick decisions and I hesitated tormented by my inability to make up my mind  How easily a single word from me could decide Lawrensons life or death Or Williamss life or deathor the life and death of both of them Like all hesitant people I procrastinated I put off deciding for twelve hours  That night I caught myself constantly listening half asleep for a dust storm coming up  It was uncannily quiet in the cabin the sick mans heavy breathing was the only sound  After midnight Williams became delirious again  I got up and did what I could for him  When I lay down again I had made my decision  I would ask for the helicopter next morning  It was clear to me that if we took Williams back to the main camp on a trailer his injured hand would have to be secured to his chest inside the spacesuit which meant that the wound would go untreated for at least ten days  With the wound in its present state the outlook seemed more than gloomy  But next morning the sick man seemed to be feeling better  The swelling had gone down again and my drugs finally seemed to be taking effectand when I saw that the sky was clouded over with a dull yellow haze I was quite glad I need not send for the helicopter  The weather had decided for me  When I called back to base we agreed that I would report as soon as the weather cleared  Williams drank a whole can of fruit juice and said he felt fairly good  Then he noticed how unusually quiet it was and asked where the others were  I told him the truth that they had gone to look for a way over the rocky ridge  Williams at once felt guilty because we were sitting here in the cabin useless  To make things easier for him I assured him that the heavy Astra couldnt have got over this terrain  I didnt tell him that the engine had broken downit hardly seemed the right moment  He obviously wanted to ask more questions but luckily he fell asleep in mid-sentence  I passed the whole day in a strangely pleasant peaceful frame of mind  Several times it occurred to me that I was a shipwrecked sailor on a desert planet but the thought did not make me feel melancholy  On the contrary I sat for hours by the window feeling that time with all its griefs pains and torments was standing still  That evening the expedition came back worn out  Their attempt to cross the rocky ridge of the Barrier with the tractors had ended in failure  The country was absolutely impassable  Next day the expedition set out on a new attempt  The men were still exhausted they did not say a word  OBrien whose eyes had been glowing feverishly for days led them south-east and once again I saw them disappear in clouds of dust  Williams was sleeping nearly all the time now  The swelling on the lower part of his arm had gone down completely  I watched the sky clear feeling irresolute  At midday the landscape was flooded in bright sunlight and the Barrier shone with pink hoarfrost  I radioed back to base where the sky had been quite clear for two hours  But Morphy reported another fall in the barometer  I felt ashamed of myself but I tried to shift the decision for the Dragonfly to take off back to the captain  He could judge the meteorological situation better than me Thats my problem Cosby he replied rather brusquely  I want your opinion as a doctor  Does Williams need to be flown back or not Ill give you five minutes to think it over no more Then I saw us hauling the groaning Williams over an endless sea of dust dunesand without any more thought I said Yes The captain informed me briefly that Lawrenson could take off in about forty minutes time  I would get exact confirmation  Meanwhile I was to get signal flares ready  Forty minutes later base reported another drop in atmospheric pressure and a dust cloud approaching from the north-east  The captain countermanded the order for the Dragonfly to take off  I sat by the window feeling depressed and watching the monotonous twinkling of the stars in the afternoon sky  Soon after three oclock a gust of wind shook the cabin  Williams woke up and asked where we were  How many kilometres had we done I took his temperature  It was rising again  Then I tried to make radio contact with the expedition which must be somewhere on the Barrier but all I could hear was the howling of the wind  Oddly enough the idea that the expedition might be lost left me unmoved  So did my own isolation on these rocks  Alone for ever   A pleasant sense of weariness came over me my brain longed for rest blissful rest       the shrill signal of the monitoring device on the oxygen regenerator sounded bringing me out of my lethargy  Id forgotten to change the container of chemicals on the reserve regenerator  I fumbled with the container for what seemed an eternity with strangely heavy limbs the result of oxygen deficiency before I managed to get it in place and switch the system to Full  After a few moments my lethargy disappeared  I treated Williams and hurried into the pressure chamber to put on my spacesuit  With feverish haste I took the rocket flares and went out into the storm  I braced my legs wide apart but I could hardly keep on my feet in the wind so I leaned my back against the cabin wall and sent up the first rocket  High above me a green light flared for a few seconds in the murky twilight the wind carried it north-west above the smooth battlements of rock  I sent up rockets at quarter-hourly intervals for the next two hours  It was beginning to get dark when I saw the tractors searchlights  I switched on the Astras own lights and crawled back through the airlock  The expedition came back with only one trailer  I finally learned from my silent companions who were almost dropping with exhaustion that there had been a landslip on the slope of a crater  One trailer and its load had to be sacrificed so that the tractor at least could be saved  Mentally I calculated the reduction of water and oxygen supplies caused by the accident  The storm raged all night and for two more days  The whole expedition including the return journey had been planned to take sixty days and thirty of them had already passed  We could live much longer on the supplies originally intended for the relief post we were to set up in the Sinus Sabaeus area but the losses we had suffered had reduced these reserves a good deal  However once the wind died down a little on the thirty-seventh day OBrien insisted on making a third attempt to cross the Barrier  This time he was going to take just one tractor and a trailer loaded only with the most essential supplies  I was surprised that no one protested about such recklessnessas if they were all infected by his obsession with the Promised Land on the other side of the Barrier  OBrien did not report his plan to base  Since Williams was not improving very fast I kept my doubts to myself and only hoped that the weather would settle the question at last and the Dragonfly would turn up after all  I had a feelingperhaps it was the result of several days rest and recuperationthat I was the only rational man among us  Things took a dramatic turn over the next two days  The expedition of eight men with one tractor and trailer set out in a strong wind to make a last attempt to cross the Barrier  Hardly two hours after Williams and I were left alone in the cabin of the Astra the oxygen regenerators warning signal sounded again  This time the container was full  I switched over to the other system realising that there must be a fault in the first one which I couldnt repair myself  I felt very nervous after that  The idea that the second system might break down too became more and more intense  I called back to base to speak to Jenkins and he tried to tell me how to repair the mechanism but on hearing my inexpert questions he said No George youd better leave it alone And listen dont take anything apart  The two systems are connected and the second one might stop working too  So all I could do was put my trust in technology  After all in the unlikely event of both systems failing we still had our spacesuits  There was no chance of the Dragonflys taking off  Back at base which was in a dust area visibility was down to two metres because of the dust haze  Here I could see the landscape for a distance of five hundred metres around me but the sky was covered by a veil of dust  It was a gloomy day and Williams was getting worse again  It was nearly dark when the transmitter on the tractor reported back  OBrien told me they had almost reached the top of the mountain ridge but they could not take the tractor any further  They were going to stay with it overnight and next morning OBrien McKinley Sheldon and Briggs would try to get to the other side carrying only the most essential oxygen and water supplies while the rest of them stayed on top of the mountain with a stock of signal rockets  I said exactly what I thought of this crazy plan but after a while I realised that OBrien had cut me off  That evening Williams began raving about a river again and then about a tree  I gave him an injection and called back to base  The captain was furious when he heard about OBriens plan and ordered me to get in touch with the expedition at once and tell them that no one was to leave the tractor with its load of supplies  Finally the captain brought himself to strike a direct blow he ordered the expedition to return to base  I tried to raise the Lizard but there was no reply  Outside the wind was howling on a single note  The sleeping Williams was breathing loud and heavily  Next day I tried to make radio contact with the men up on the Barrier again  Still no good  My earphones were silent  There was only the wind outside howling all day and all night while Williams kept talking about a tree and a river  The expedition did not get back until late afternoon of the next day  The men were exhausted ready to drop  None of them said a word and not just because they were tired  It was not until much later that I found out what had actually happened up there  OBrien McKinley Sheldon and Briggs did get across the Barrier to find a bleak tract of tumbled rocks ahead disappearing into the grey mist  They went on through this desolate landscape until midday  OBrien wanted to go still further  But the danger was so obvious that McKinley Sheldon and Briggs refused and at last OBrien gave in  There was no alternative we had to go back  Mans life depends on very simple thingswater and air and there was nothing but dead stone on this inhuman planet  We had just enough air and water left  We crawled through the desert for fourteen days making endless detours in a murky twilight with the wind blowing all the timeand in the evening everyone counted up the kilometres we had covered the water and air we still had  Williams lay on the swaying trailer he had stopped counting  From time to time he woke from his stupor  When I bent over him I saw his face alarmingly thin behind the visor of his helmet  He managed a smile when he recognised me  I put a tube in his mouth and watched him drink  He was the only one of us allowed to drink all he wantedand the only one who didnt know how precious the water he was drinking was  Watching his face I felt as though the wind were dropping the sky clearing the stars shining and one star was flying towards us getting biggerthe Dragonfly But no it was only imagination  The north-east wind kept flinging clouds of dust over us and on the fifteenth day the wind increased to become a storm  We made an emergency camp of the two Lizards and the trailer and there we spent five dark hopeless days  I kept reassuring myself that Williams was still breathing  We shovelled away the dust slept in shifts and helped each other stick it out  Overnight the wind unexpectedly died down and next morning there were stars in the sky  We radioed to base and got signal flares ready  I bent over Williams  When I knocked at his helmet he opened his eyes  I felt that he was looking straight through me at something very far away  Its all right Henry I called  The Dragonfly is coming at once Do you hear me He didnt seem to  The Dragonfly I repeated  The Dragonflydo you hear me do you understand His thin face distorted itself into a smile again and I heard his broken gasping voice in my earphones  Yes I understand       dragonfly       flying over the river     Less than an hour later the Dragonfly hovered above our camp and came slowly down to land  Williams was dead  There was no hurry any more  Lawrenson wanted to take the weakest member of the expedition back to base but no one would admit to being the weakest so he took the corpse of Williams back instead  Three days later we reached base in calm sunny weather  Nothing seemed to have changed over those sixty-three daysno there was something different  A mound of stones stood on top of a dune not far from the camp  On the largest stone in rather lopsided letters Morphy had chiselled the inscription Henry Williams  The First Man on Mars  PART The Great March CHAPTER 21 Outwardly nothing had changed back at base except that the dust dunes were higher on the sides away from the wind and the bright paint on the metal structures had been completely scoured off by sand on the windward side  Morphys meteorological station had gone grey  Even the stone grave mound was only a small change in that sea of stone and dust  But we ourselves had changed  It was not that our bodies were dried out and in poor condition our relationships with each other had dried up too  We were struggling for life with every breath we drew every mouthful of water we swallowed every morsel we ateand that life was just too hard  We had forgotten everything except our duties the most important of which was to survive here for another two hundred and forty days and we saw everything else from this viewpoint  Watts who had dissected Williamss body to determine the cause of death wrote a long painstaking report on it  Briefly the gist of it was cardiac arrest progressive gangrene changes in the blood count and total failure of the bodys natural powers of resistance  Even taking Williams back to base the first day after he was injured would not have saved him but all the same I felt that the captain held OBrien and myself partly to blame for his death  Everything here was judged by the chilly criterion of our duties  We had a job to do that was all  I could understand OBriens longing to touch something living something warmer than a few cold mineral samples in no way different from those brought back to Earth by the unmanned probes  And we were paying so high a price just for this I couldnt help thinking that we were after something which fled faster the harder we chased it  For a few days after we got back we took no interest in anything but sleeping eating and drinking and resting  But then our animal spirits revived and the shadow of Henrys death gradually diminished in the hard light of reality  An expedition to Mars is not a dream but a life and death struggle  Everyone met in the clubroom to discuss a new planthe plan for what we called The Great March  We used the experience we had gained from our previous failed expedition  This time only five men were to stay at base Glennon the chief engineer the astrophysicist Wellgarth Jenkins to look after radio communications Morphy and Dr Watts Lawrenson and Silcott were to stand by with the Dragonfly  The new twelve-man team was to set out for Sion with four Lizards and their trailers following our old route and using the stranded mobile laboratory as a relief post  We would use the considerable fuel supplies left on the large trailer and make a wide detour to the west around the Barrier hoping to set up a way station on the edge of Sinus Sabaeus  From here a six-man group would try to reach Deucalionis Regio with two tractors  The expedition was to wait for fair weather at Sion and then fire off rockets to ensure good orientation and safe landing for the Dragonfly  The Dragonflys crew Lawrenson and Silcott were to stay with the Astra until the Sinus Sabaeus station was ready then they could transfer to it when the weather was favourable  Once there the prospects of reaching Deucalionis Regio did not look too bad  The whole Great March including a reserve of time was planned to take a hundred and fifty days  Taking into account our experiences on the first expedition which had lasted sixty-three days and the test drives we had made near the base the plan was feasible  Then as we were preparing for the Great March a bombshell burst  The geological party which was carrying out deep-drilling operations in the vicinity came back with the sensational news that they had found the ruins of a city in the desert roughly fifty kilometres north of base  We took this for a silly joke especially as McKinley was leader of the geological team but McKinley was much annoyed by our incredulity and said he was only sorry he hadnt been able to get close enough to the object to bring back a brick or something as proofthe weather had been getting worse at the time and the party was carrying only very limited supplies of water and oxygen  We didnt really get excited until we were shown some staggering pictures taken with a telephoto lens  They showed the partly dust-covered remains of something which it was difficult to describe as anything but the ruins of enormous buildings  OBrien was so upset by the sheer absurdity of this discovery that he flatly refused to examine the pictures more closely as if there were something frightening about them  I dont think any of us were inclined to believe fairy tales of some lost Martian civilisation yet the discovery had to be investigated more closely  In fact it may have been precisely OBriens dislike of the whole affair that persuaded the captain to take it seriously  He suggested a six-man expedition with two Lizards which could reach the city in a day and a half  Using the Dragonfly was out of the question the prevailing north wind was raising a thick dust haze  The captain intended to lead the expedition himself thus plainly showing how important he thought it  Whether that was his intention or not the result was different from anything he himself could have expected  OBrien flared up claimed that the whole thing was a hoax and the pictures showed perfectly ordinary rock formations and described the captain as an amateur  With things as they were this remark made in front of the whole crew was so offensive that I waited anxiously for the captains reaction  There were a few seconds of painful silence  Then Captain Norton said OBrien I know youre under pressure and this must be a strain on you but I must ask you to apologise for that remark Im not under such pressure that I cant keep my temper  I have nothing to apologise for said OBrien and he left the clubroom  The quarrel was assuming alarming proportions I thought Id better go and look for OBrien but he refused to listen to me saying he didnt need a go-between  The captain wouldnt listen to me either and on top of that he accused me of being responsible for OBriens poor leadership of the expedition on which Williams had died  I was losing my own temper by now  Captain if you intend to blame OBrien for Williamss death I said sharply you might as well add that my treatment killed him Yes I might snapped the captain  So far as I can venture to judge an expert being an amateur myself  I took a deep breath  This is leading nowhere I told myself or else its leading somewhere very nasty indeed  A human being shouldnt be the victim of his exacerbated nerves like some primitive life form  I began Captain       but I couldnt think what to say next  I turned and left him  The men were talking a lot more about the disagreement between their leaders than about the mysterious city  The tense situation affected everyone  They kept arguing about the rights and wrongs of it we seemed to be succumbing to hysteria again under these extraterrestrial conditions  The captain insisted on an apology from OBrien in front of the whole expedition  I found that he had even decided on his own responsibility to threaten to relieve OBrien of his post as leader of the scientific team and leave him at base during the Great March  I dont know if it was this threat or a flash of normal terrestrial reason which finally broke OBriens prideor rather obstinacyand led him to offer the captain the required apology  The whole distasteful scene was acted out before the entire company  Both OBrien and the captain sounded cool and stilted and a sense of weariness and futility overcame me  I remembered a favourite saying of Watts that nothing in the world was perfect  I felt my own imperfections more than ever now  When things had settled down at base at least outwardly the weather too improved as if to make a positive contribution  The wind died down to a light breeze and the sun shone through the slight dust haze which still lingered in the atmosphere  Morphy had enough experience of the local weather conditions by now for the captain to feel justified in giving permission for the Dragonfly to take off for the mysterious ruined city instead of the proposed six-man expedition  Lawrenson and McKinley flew off and we waited in suspense by the radio equipment for them to report back  The ruins had seemed to be only about fifty kilometres from base which meant fifteen to twenty minutes flying time for the helicopter  But Lawrenson and McKinley did not report back till half an hour later they had been having orientation problems in the monotonous desert  The trail left by the tractors had blown away long ago so they had no point of reference  But fifteen minutes later McKinley told us they were above the city and about to land  Judging by his unmistakable lack of enthusiasm the city really did seem about to fall into ruins now  Ten minutes later he reported back again  Nothing specialjust weathered rocks partly buried in drifts of sand  Thus ended the sensation of the Martian city  Later when McKinley and Compton compared the original photographs taken with the telephoto lens with the new ones they came to the conclusion that the fancied similarity to buildings was due to refraction of the sunlight in the dusty atmosphere over the dark shapes of the rocks  So we could go back to our preparations for the Great March  We didnt send reports of either of these embarrassing incidentsthe split in the company and the Martian city affairback to Earth in our radio transmissions  We told ourselves they werent really typical  CHAPTER 22 In contrast to our first expedition the second began in bad weather  A brisk wind was chasing streams of dust over the ground they flowed into each other to form a wide ghostly river  No one stopped to wonder what drew us on into that hazy distance what it was that made us do without all that means a semblance of human life  It was like the pull of a giant magnet  We drove through the dust raised by the tractors we drove through yellowish-grey dust clouds hurled across the endless plain of the Edom desert by the north-west wind we drove slowly south  The overloaded trailer delayed our progress  The second day was even worse  We found larger and larger drifts of flowing dust on the sides of the dunes away from the wind and the Lizards kept getting stuck  The dust raised by the tractors and carried back on the wind obscured the drivers view so observation was trickier too  The third day was just like the second the fourth just like the third  We missed the cabin of the Astra where we had been able to get out of our heavy spacesuits  We lay on the ground by night separated from a freezing death only by a thin layer of insulating material breathing measured doses of life while currents of deadly gases tossed in the ocean of the Martian atmosphere from the north pole to the equator  After ten days we were quarter of the way to Sion  The wind was not so strong now though its monotonous incessant voice pierced our metal helmets and went right through our heads  However it was the only voice and the only movement there was in this shoreless desert  The wind did not die down completely until the sixteenth day  Gradually like a photograph in the developing bath the pale picture of the desert began to emerge from the fog around us  Eleven days of complete calm followed  This was ideal weather and we managed to skirt around the dust swamp area  At midday the sun was almost directly overhead shining down on the desert with a bright clear light making the dust look pastel-coloured the finest dust was a glittering silvery grey the fine sand bright ochre the patches of larger stones were rust-coloured while those rocks and boulders that were free of dust gleamed as if they had been coated with dark red-brown varnish  Then one day about noon small silvery needles of hoarfrost began to fall from the dark violet sky  There was still no wind and they floated as slowly and rhythmically down to the ground as if the mechanism driving the complicated clockwork of the universe were running down itself  In a freakish mood of kindness the cruel desert seemed to want to show the softer side of its nature  As the silver rain died away several coloured rings formed around the sun with shimmering light flaring out from their rims  In the solemn silence with the sky vaulting overhead like the great dome of a cathedral I felt as though we were touching something inexpressibly tender  Then the rays of light began to fade and disperse and the desert was dead and dull again  Twelve hours later we discovered the price we had to pay for this brief moment of beauty and enchantment  About midnight the distant droning howl of a dust storm woke us  Our hearts sank as we fastened safety ropes to the Lizards and their trailers  A treacherous silence rested on the dunes and the motionless dust shone dully in the starlight  We put our own safety ropes on  The roar of the storm increased it sounded like a great avalanche of stones hurtling through the desert  The first onslaught covered our camp with a mass of dust  The raging storm lashed the camp for three days and three nights  No sooner did we succeed in freeing one tractor or trailer from dust than another would disappear under the drifts  In the twilight that was neither day nor night everything seemed huge so that we looked like a band of dark monstrous robots doomed for all eternity to swing shovels suffer thirst and go without sleepgo without sleep and suffer thirst  When the storm finally ended we fell to the ground exhausted and stayed there all day  I dont think the will to live is a particularly human characteristic a broken tree will grow up again an animal will survive appalling wounds  There seems to be some curious equation whereby a living creatures powers of resistance are directly related to the degree of its primitiv-ity the simpler an organism the tougher its instinct for survival  But the willingness to pay for bare knowledge with ones lifethat is specifically human  There was no wind now but the atmosphere was so full of dust after the storm that visibility was down to a hundred metres  At last we came to the area of the stony plains  By our reckoning Sion could not be far off now  But it wouldnt be easy to get there in this fog and we were worried because we hadnt managed to make radio contact with base since the day before  Had the storm damaged the antenna Had something even worse happened Then we tried to get a fix on our position only to find that the instruments on the eastern direction finder in the Edom desert were not reacting  If anyone were to search for the critical moment in the history of the expedition to Mars it was here on the dry dusty stony plains of the Edom desert  This was the turning point  Everything else falls into the time before and the time after  Everything that followed bore the marks of this unlucky place  We could determine our position now only by occasional assessments  We had to reject the idea that the Dragonfly without navigational instruments might be able to find the damaged radio installation out in the monotonous desert  This meant that the whole plan of the Great March was flawed  The bleak country that still lay between us and Deucalionis Regio could become a deathtrap if we lost our way  In this situation it was natural that the captain to whom safety was of primary importance clung to the one reliable thing we still had the direction finder at base  The burden of responsibility for the human lives entrusted to him meant that he couldnt spread his wings like an eagle and return to the attack  He suggested a return to base to OBrien  OBrien asked him to postpone his decision until we got to Sion  Other members of the expedition did not agree with each other and all the captain could do was accept this compromise  While base remained in radio silence we went on with the march in search of Sion  I thought of the words the captain had flung in my face I thought of Williams lying under the mound of stones and I found myself registering this sign of a setback for the captain with a pleasant sense of satisfaction  Rather horrified I summoned reason to my helpbut reason told me that nothing in the world is perfect least of all ones moral standards  That evening base got through to us  Jenkins was at the transmitter  He told us that the main antenna had been damaged by the storm but was working again and except for the fact that the entire third freighter was buried in dust everything was all right  Then Law-renson came on the air asking when he and Silcott could take off  His good humour was in sharp contrast with our low spirits out here in the desert  The captain did not reply for some moments  Then he said Law-renson the eastern finder isnt working  We could hear Lawrenson swearing then there was silence for a few seconds  As if reading Lawrensons thoughts the captain strictly forbade him to try looking for the radio mast in the Dragonfly  That ended our conversation with base  No one mentioned the return of the expedition now  To give me something serious to occupy my mind Trott came to me complaining of something wrong with his circulation  I asked him what and he said he had cold feet and headaches  Thinking this was the result of his exertions over the last few days I said Oh youre just getting old Irwin However Trott said he felt as if he had no toes on his feet  That did sound serious  An unpleasant thought occurred to me  In the glare of the Lizards searchlights I inspected Trotts heavy steel shoe which was welded to the impenetrable spacesuit  The metal surface was covered with scratches and the spacesuit had been scoured with sand up to the knees  I couldnt actually see anything wrong but if the suit was damaged there was no hope of changing it before we found the Astra  Next morning Trott was unconscious  I could tell he was still alive only because his body was not rigid  We put him on the Red Lizards trailer and continued our march in the dust haze with the sunlight filtering weakly through it  Towards midday the haze dispersed  Trott was still alive  When I shook him he opened his eyes but he did not react to my words  Although he was lying down we kept his oxygen pack on at Full  In the distance a rocky hill stood out sharply against the dark horizon  Was it Sion Three hours later we were close enough to make out individual clefts and crevices in the rocks but there was nothing to show that we were at our goal  The sun sank towards the horizon flooding the nameless rock group which we christened Pseudosion with red light  The night mist came down unusually early spreading an opaque veil over the landscapeand only now with Trott and his freezing feet lying beside us did we all feel the cosmic frost that shares mastery of this planet with the wind take us by the throat  Next day we dragged Trott on with us to another lonely rock group  Apart from us and our machines nothing moved in the indifferent desert  Im hardened to a lot of things but Im not hard enough to watch with indifference while a friend dies beside me  I think I was beginning to hate this cruel desert which I had once so longed to see  I was separated from Trott who needed my help by an armoured wall that no doctor no human being could penetrate  I thought the rock formation ahead looked like Sionand yet I wouldnt believe it so as not to be disappointed  I still didnt believe it when I heard McKinleys voice in my earphones  He was at the head of the column calling back that he could see the Astra  I took this for one of Natures cruel jokes I thought the shape at the foot of the rock was an ordinary square boulder  But soon I could make out the windows of the cabin  Fearing a blow from another direction I made sure that Trott was still alive  When I shook his helmet gently he opened his eyes  I told him wed reach the Astra before too long but I looked in vain for any sign of relief in his face  About an hour later the expedition reached the Astras cabin  It had been brightly painted at the beginning of the march but now it stood there bare and cold as the surrounding rocks  While we ran the oxygen regenerator and the heating of the cabin at Fuff Trott whom we had eased out of his spacesuit drank hot tea  His toes were frostbitten as the result of slight damage to the spacesuit and he was completely exhausted by lack of oxygen  The first word he uttered hoarsely after so many hours silence was Warm It was more than I had dared to hopeand at that moment I realised what warm really meant  Although we had to divide the crew into shifts to rest in the cabin of the Astra so that all twelve of us could have a chance to sleep without wearing a spacesuit Sion was an oasis of safety and comfort after the hardships we had suffered particularly once Gray had repaired the other oxygen system  However the cabin brought back memories of the days I had spent here with Williams which didnt help to cheer me up and as if the place had some sort of curse on it I had another sick man to nurse  I remembered those endless days of groaning fever delirium and blood  Trott clung to his life with cat-like tenacity  After twenty-four hours rest his condition had improved so much that he was conscious all the time but I was horrified by the thought that surgery might be necessary  The tragic fate of Williams rose before my eyes  If I had to operate on his feet Trott would not be able to wear his spacesuit at all  Once again I pinned my hopes on the Dragonfly it could transport the injured man to base where he would have rest and comfort and Wattss help  It had to be done as soon as possible  The captain agreed with me and gave reluctant permission for the helicopter to take off  The meteorological situation would be the deciding factor  That evening we talked the whole thing over with base and waited to see what the weather was like next morning  Once the morning mist had dispersed the sun flooded Sion and the surrounding country with soft pink light  The desert was at peace  At eight oclock we heard from base where the weather was excellent and the barometer steady  Lawrenson was ready to take off  I had the feeling that even now the captain hesitated to give the go-ahead  A flight over the monotonous desert without navigational instruments was a tricky proposition even in good weather  After an hour we began sending up signal rockets  The whistling blinding balls of light rose like green suns into the vast height of the thin atmosphere  When after another tense half-hour a moving silvery dot appeared among the stars on the northern horizon we all shouted like a crowd of schoolboys  There wasnt much else here to shout about  The Dragonfly landed on a rocky plateau about fif- teen metres from the Astra  Lawrenson had barely described his flight in a few sentences before the captain was urging him to start back  We filled up the Dragonflys fuel tanks  Trott who was back in his spacesuit and consequently in great pain was carried into the Dragonfly and soon the jets were raising dust and small stones underneath it  The helicopter rose high circled above the Astra and flew north  When it had disappeared among the stars on the horizon the whole thing seemed like a dream or a figment of our overheated imaginations  It was as if those last few minutes had documented something that never really existed but for the fact that Trotts bunk in the cabin was empty  We had thought of the Dragonflys coming so much and so often and it had all happened far too fastlike Elijah appearing in a chariot of fire as McKinley said  However it had been Lawrenson all right an hour and a half later a transmission from base told us that the Dragonfly had just landed  The friction between the captain and OBrien began to get worse after the Dragonflys successful flight  OBrien was fascinated by the ease with which the helicopter crossed three hundred kilometres of desert  How simple it would be for him and Lawrenson to reach Deucalionis Regio the goal of the expedition and so carry out the main mission of the whole Mars shot And the hardships we were suffering as we crawled on at snails pace making countless detours seemed so pointless He begged the captain not to make any over-hasty decisions about turning back and suggested that Lawrenson and Silcott might take advantage of the good weather and their recent experience and fly back to Sion that very day  From our base there we could take off in the helicopter for further flights in the Sinus Sabaeus areawe could even get to Deucalionis Regio  The captain seemed less sure of himself now that the helicopter had flown here safely  I was not quite sure it was only caution that made him postpone his decision until next day  Id already discovered so many new things in the characters of all of us myself included that I even thought it possible the captain was opposing OBrien apparently on the grounds of caution but really just because OBriens persuasions irritated him  I was far from surprised when OBrien exploded bitterly Tomorrow Tomorrow could be too late The captain parried this with cold logic  Well what use would the Dragonfly be here if the weather is worse tomorrow It would have the risks of the flight from base behind it replied OBrien equally logically  When I left the Astras cabin that night to let Compton take over my bunk the frost glittered under my feet in the shimmering starlight  I was quite close to my companions yet I felt as if I were in a dream a dream that had dumped me down in some unimaginably distant uninhabited world  Stranded in that world I felt longing and fear at the same time   I felt I had been here before       but all I could remember about it was the uncertain feeling of vanishing youth  Next morning when the exceptionally thick and frosty atmospheric fog dispersed a long silvery grey streak remained hanging above the northern horizon  After a while a huge shining bow of rainbow colours arched above the whole western horizon hanging in the atmosphere for a full twenty minutes  Base reported sunshine and no wind  No change in Trotts condition so far  OBrien made no comment nothing seemed to interest him  The captain told Lawrenson and Silcott to be ready to take off for Sion that morning and wait for the signal  An hour later he radioed back his veto instead  The barometer at Sion had dropped suddenly within the space of ten minutes the atmospheric temperature had risen seven degrees and small sparkling needles were beginning to float down from the sky  We guessed what was coming and hurried to secure the loads on the trailers  I thought I sensed a certain satisfaction in both OBrien and the captain each for his own reasons  By midday there was a light haze over the whole landscape  We expected to hear the rushing sound that preceded a storm but the afternoon passed in oppressive silence  OBrien asked the captain to let the expedition go on south next morning saying that as opinions were divided about using the Dragonfly staying any longer at Sion was an unnecessary waste of time  We must have something to outweigh all the sacrifices weve made all weve been through he said  We must at least get to Sinus Sabaeus OBrien didnt even mention the possibility of an immediate return to base and the captain seemed to be acting very democratically when he asked each of us to say what he thought before he gave his own opinion but I knew him too well not to guess what lay behind the gesture  He was a soldier he foresaw a fierce battle and he wanted to see the enemys full strength first  The expedition was divided into two groups of differing size  Surprisingly the majority agreed with OBrien that so much effort ought not to go for nothing  I dont know what it was that drew us south so irresistibly  None of us expected to find an island of para-disal lifeyet the impulse was stronger than caution or cold reason  I wondered if Man would ever have walked on two legs or built spaceships if Nature had given him caution and cold reason right from the start The storm did not break in the night  The barometer was steady  Next morning the whole expedition set off south-west in poorish visibility  By noon Sion was lying somewhere beyond a horizon which had vanished into the fog and by evening it was just a memory lost in the vast expanses of the Martian wilderness  I dont know if it was simply because I was so tired but I suddenly got an uncomfortable feeling that we had taken a fateful step and lost something of inestimable value  CHAPTER 23 The sky was veiled from horizon to horizon all day by a thick yellowish grey dust haze raised by the wind  Up there it was windy but down below only a slight breeze stirred the sand  The sunlight filtering through the haze lit the landscape without casting harsh shadows  In this deceptive light everything looked calm and peaceful and yet I could not get rid of the feeling that we had fallen right into a trap  The Barrier lay ahead  No threatening towering cragsonly the moderate rise of a scree slope with a few veins of weathered rock running through it partly covered by dust  The long detour to the south-west seemed to have paid off  The Lizards and their trailers got up the slope without too much difficulty  Had we finally made it About midday we reached the ridge of the Barrier  No cliffs to bar our way here either  So far as we could see in the haze the whole ridge consisted of smooth rocks and looked like the gleaming back of a huge buffalo  The inclination of the south-east slope of the Barrier was even slighter than that of the slope we had just climbed  The way south was open We saw the rocky desert merging into the grey veils of mist and we felt invigorated and full of hope again  If the weather held and none of the machines broke down a single day would bring us to the edge of Sinus Sabaeus  After a short rest we went due south  The going looked positively ideal  The shallow stony ground was partly covered with dust which filled the hollows and the Lizards could practically race each other  We felt quite intoxicated  A few moments later the Barrier struck for the first time and it struck hard  The Blue Lizard driving at the head of the column suddenly disappeared in a cloud of dust  In our earphones we heard the warning from the Red Lizard directly behind it  We stopped  A slight gust of wind blew away the dust and the Blue Lizard came back into sight  It was tilted over almost lying on its side its nose buried deep in the dust  Its trailer which had tipped over had lost part of its load  Sheldon and Compton were helping Gray the driver of the Blue Lizard he seemed to be unable to stand  As I hurried towards him I thought with horror that it would be quite impossible to dress a wound  He was groaning with pain his knee was hurt  I was relieved to find that his spacesuit was not damaged  All I could do was hope that it was only a question of a bruised kneecap  I saw his face through the transparent visor as I asked him if he felt he was bleedingit was covered with sweat and distorted by pain  I could only prescribe a brief rest  We put Gray down on the ground and looked around to discover how the accident had actually happened  I heard a shout in my earphones and saw a cloud of dust rise beside the tilted trailer Compton who had been hurrying towards the trailer sank into the dust feet first and disappeared from sight  Briggs quickly threw him a rope which was lying beside the trailer and when the dust settled we saw that Sheldon who had been first to go and examine the damaged vehicle was in up to his chest with only his helmet and his two outstretched arms sticking out  We pulled Compton and Sheldon out of the dust on ropes  When we investigated the treacherous ground near the Red Lizard we found a crater filled with the finest of dust  We could not guess at its depth but it would certainly have been able to swallow more than one man  By now Gray had recovered enough to talk and I was able to make sure that his knee was not broken  Sheldon and Compton had escaped with slight bruising too so now we could all concentrate on the Lizard  We did succeed in pulling it out of the dust but its engine refused to start  Sheldon and Briggs in their clumsy gloves tried to repair the damage until evening but it was no good  The wind had risen and was now quite strong and as we did not want to spend the night on the windward side of the Barrier we hitched the reloaded trailer up to the Red Lizard and drove cautiously along the slope to a group of large boulders  We pitched camp there for the night keeping out of the wind  As a fine rain of sand drizzled down from the sky the abandoned Lizard up on the ridge lost all appearance of being a work made by human hands it was becoming part of the desert  The loss of the tractor slowed us down  The Red Lizard was now towing two trailers and it kept getting stuck  Even worse was the fear of craters hidden by dust  The south-eastern slope of the Barrier was covered in fine dust brought there over thousands of years from the vast belt of desert over the northern hemisphere of Mars carried on the summer winds  The driver of the leading tractor could never know what lay hidden just ahead under the layer of dust  We were now on the side of the Barrier that was protected from the wind and though it still seemed calm weather visibility was getting worse and worse  Apparently the wind was blowing on the other side of the ridge driving dust across the Barrier  Our earlier optimism was quite gone  All we had left was willpower and that was gradually turning to a dull sense of endurance  Grays knee was giving him pain he couldnt stand on that leg at all and there was no hope of its healing itself satisfactorily in the near future without treatment  He said nothing but I knew what he was thinking he had become a drag on the expedition  Unfortunately that was the hard truth  We had so much trouble with the extra trailer that OBrien suggested leaving it behind  We had enough supplies even if we did abandon it  But the captain said we must not dispense voluntarily with any of the supplies at all  So the column crawled slowly on with great difficulty like a huge crippled caterpillar  In addition to all this the wind on our side of the Barrier began to gather the dust in the atmosphere up into a great spectral cloud  We struggled laboriously on  Night when it came did not mean rest but only a pause in the struggle  The next day was no better  There was more dust the further we got from the Barrier  The surface of the ground was just a series of pitfalls  Ten times twenty times we had to free the tractors and trailers when they got stuck always fearing that one of the bottomless pits lying in wait might swallow someone up  The gusts of wind became a storm and visibility was down to ten metres  The captain gave the word to halt  We camped where we were to wait for better weather and radioed back to base  Reception was not very good but at least we could feel we were not all alone in the universe  Back at base the storm had been raging since morning  We lay down in the shelter of our vehicles clearing away the dust drifts from time to time  And so we passed three terrible monotonous exhausting days and nights  At last the wind dropped but the atmosphere was still full of dust  However we pressed on south  We estimated that we were still about thirty kilometres from Sinus Sabaeus  The treacherous dust was all around us  Progress was possible if we took turns to walk in front of the leading tractor probing the ground with metal rods  Then half an hour before midday Sheldon told us there was something wrong with the engine of the Red Lizard  The column halted  I got down from the Green Lizard and looked around in the vague hope of seeing something other than the pale dust haze above the fine rustling sand the dusty tractors and the silent shapeless forms of my companions  My throat was dry deep inside me I felt that we had dragged our lives to a turning point and there was really nothing on the other side but a frosty eternal desert  I had guessed as much  Sheldon was working on the Red Lizards engine like a coroner whose only business is to establish the cause of death  So I was not surprised when after two hours he said he couldnt repair the fault in the fuel pump  We stood there in gloomy silence  This time the captain did not ask us for our opinions  He made his own decision quite firmly we must go back to base while we still could  No one said a word the sense of defeat was too bitter  Then OBrien spoke up  He sounded as calm and sober as if he were sitting comfortably in his laboratory  Youre a soldier Ralph he said  You know what a defeat costs Im asking you to help me now  I dont think we ought to go back  Does anyone else feel the same Some things can be influenced neither by mind nor by matter and one of them is the natural law that sends an avalanche once loosened hurtling down the mountainside destroying everything in its path  At first there is only an imperceptible quiver in the end there is total destruction  The blow rocked the captain for a moment  Then he said coldly  Im in command of this expedition  OBrien  Ive said we go back to base  That was an order  Im afraid I consider your remarks inflammatory and dangerous to the whole expedition  Anyone who ranges himself beside you is a mutineer Oh for Gods sake Ralph drop this farce shouted OBrien  Were not on Earth now Cant you see it doesnt mean a thing here If we cant come to some mutual understanding its a hopeless outlook We start back to base tomorrow morning the captain repeated  But we cant give up We have only twenty or thirty kilometres more to go before we get there Get there exploded the captain bitterly  Get where Bill Where do you want to get To some rock covered with nameless mildew thats where You want to sacrifice human lives so you can touch itlike a miser gloating over his gold No said OBrien unhappily no you really dont understand anything at all  I understand one thing all right theres no sense in this expedition to Mars if it doesnt get back to Earth said the captain turning his back on OBrien  Next morning only five men answered to the captains summons  It was as if everything were beginning to take on different dimensions in a slow and confused way but still our sense of values was changing all our old concepts of honour friendship discipline all our terrestrial standards  OBrien proposed going south for three more days  The captain refused  The column stayed put until noon  Dusty sunlight fell from the grey sky on to the motionless tractors  OBrien suggested dividing the expedition into two groups one to press on south for three days the other to wait here for its return firing signal rockets to make sure it found its way back  The captain refused to split the team and insisted on turning back  By evening the dust haze had become a dirty pink  Violet shadows rose from the shallow craters gradually flooding the surrounding desert  OBrien offered the captain a compromise just one days march south made by the whole expedition  And then we would turn back  The captain refused even to discuss it  A black starless night covered everything with frozen silence  I lay in the dust beside the Green Lizard only half asleep dreaming of staggering on among the dust drifts  When we woke up in the morning we were still in a state of painful indecision  Neither leader would try to enforce his wishes by asserting his authority and thus splitting the expedition  There was unendurable silence in the earphones of my helmet in that silence microscopic particles of dust began falling to the ground and the haze got thinner  By noon the blinding glaring lamp of the sun was hanging overhead and in its light the horizon of the desert around us seemed incredibly close  OBrien was staring southwards all the time  Obviously the bright sunshine was even more maddening than die fog to him  He made up his mind to a last attack and asked the captain to let the Dragonfly take off if the weather held  Our camp here would act as a way station and that would mean that the helicopter could at least reach Sinus Sabaeus  When it returned it could take the injured Gray back to base thus preventing possible complications  This time the captain was silent for a while and then agreed  If the fine weather did hold he would allow the Dragonfly to come in the morning  I think it was the possibility of getting Gray back to base rather than any vision of the Dragonfly landing in the Sinus Sabaeus area that swayed him  But as the corrosive pressure of uncertainty and inaction seeped away we summoned up some last remnants of energy  We got the tractors and trailers into a semicircle facing north and set up a camp  We prepared signal rockets  When the sun sank that evening the horizon looked so clear-cut and close against the flaming red of the sky that it seemed as if a few steps would take us into the wings and show us what actor was about to come on stage next  CHAPTER 24 A few minutes before ten in the morning the Dragonfly landed close to the camp  The cloud of dust it raised was slow to sink to the ground but there was no wind and the desert was in a kindly moodlike a well fed wild beast sleeping  Lawrenson had come alone on the captains orders  He was to take the injured Gray back to base on the return journey thus relieving the expedition of one man  Every time the Dragonfly made a successful flight it looked to be the best way to get around on Marsbut then I would remember the sudden fluctuations in the weather the gusts of wind the dust storms and the Dragonfly would look like a delicate fragile bird quite out of place here  Relations between the captain and OBrien were still strained but there was a kind of truce at the moment  Both men had agreed to wait and see if the weather seemed good enough to be trusted for the next twenty-four hours if it did and there were no other difficulties the Dragonfly would fly on to the Sinus Sabaeus area next morning  After much thought OBrien had to agree to Lawrensons making the flight alone hard as it was on OBrien himself  This meant first that the helicopter could carry the maximum amount of fuel in case Lawrenson got lost on the way back and second that he could bring back as many rock samples as possiblesamples which we hoped would carry traces of living organisms  We fell into a fever of impatience watching the air pressure gauge and the sky in mounting suspense  When Lawrenson climbed into the Dragonfly we knew the next few hours would loom large in the history of Marsbut no one guessed how much those few hours were to affect all our lives  One last wave and the transparent hood shut down over the cockpit  The helicopters saucer-shaped body striped with dull orange was enveloped in a cloud of dust took off and climbed slowly upwards  We watched it circle slowly over the camp and fly off south we felt mingled delight and anxiety with a touch of envy  A few moments later it was just one of the cold sparkling stars in the sky and then it disappeared entirely  We heard Lawrensons voice through the receiver on the Green Lizard telling us that he was climbing higher so as to get a better view  Then there was radio silence for quarter of an hour  In his next transmission he told us he was at a height of two thousand metres  Then another lengthy silence  We hardly recognised his voice when it next came over it was so excited  It looks like a blue-grey sea Lawrenson was almost shouting  It goes on and on right over the whole southern horizon There are rusty orange spots in parts and grey-green patches       its fantastic  I can hardly describe it       Im signing off now for a few moments  I want to mark my approximate position on the map       Then our earphones went dead  Lawrenson did not report back  Lawrenson never reported back again at all  At first we thought there must be something wrong with the Green Lizards receiver  But the Yellow Lizards receiver was silent too  Was something wrong with the Dragonfly We never discovered the true cause of the accident  After endless hours of tormenting silence we began to fire off signal rockets at quarter-hour intervals until noon while the sun shone down on the uncaring desert  After midday the captain ordered us to economise on rockets and send them up only once an hour  As evening came on we held a conference  Lawrenson had food and drink for five days with him  In real emergency he could get by for double that time  But his oxygen couldnt last more than ten days provided he had managed to land safely at all  We estimated that the Dragonfly would be about a hundred kilometres from our camp as the crow flies at the time of Lawren-sons last radio transmission  It was clearly beyond us to undertake a rescue operation with the two tractors over that distance  In any case finding the Dragonfly in this vast desert would be like looking for a needle in a haystack and the attempt would increase the danger already threatening the lives of eleven men  All this supposing that Lawrenson had not died instantly when the accident happened  The captain made his calculations in cold blood as if he were doing a sum  He de- 1 cided that we would stay where we were for ten days the longest that Lawrensons supply of oxygen could f possibly last  We told them back at base that the flight had been postponed  OBrien thrown completely off balance by what had happened accused the captain of cowardice and said he was going to lead a rescue team of volunteers himself  I may be cowardly replied the captain brusquely but how do I describe someone who hides his own ambition behind a heroic mask of self-sacrifice I know all you want is to go on south OBrien retained at least a semblance of self-control though with difficulty  All right he said  So now we know what to think of each other If I can get at least four volunteers well start off south tomorrow with the Yellow Lizard  McKinley Vaux and Thompson volunteered so  rather uncertainly did Briggs  The expedition divided into two groups  I decided to stay with the captain not after long consideration of the rights and wrongs of the question not after thinking about courage and cowardice and self-sacrifice and God knows what else  No I was just afraid to go on  All my enthusiasm had evaporated I had nothing left but the wish to get out of this alive  OBriens group set off early in the morning soon after the frost had dispersed on the sunlit slopes of the dunes  It seemed the only possible thing to do and that fact blunted the edge of the quarrel between the leaders so that our parting went off without any particular emotion  The captain saw that the group had enough supplies and fixed times for radio transmissions with OBrien  We watched the small party go until the Yellow Lizard vanished behind a ridge with its trailer and then we all seemed to freeze inside  About midday a large rainbow-coloured ring formed around the sun gradually losing in intensity until it disappeared entirely at around two oclock  However the barometer remained steady we shot off rockets from time to time but the green flares brought no response  That evening OBrien called back to us  The Yellow Lizard had gone a good way in exceptionally fine weather  I felt as though all of us left back in the camp were a little ashamed and I think our consciences pricked us as we went to sleepnot that anyone said so but we felt it pretty strongly  I woke before midnight with an odd sense of panic  Perhaps the air conditioning had gone wrong But as soon as I took a couple of deep breaths the panic was over  I dont know what it was that woke mesome ancient instinct inherited from our primeval ancestors that warns every living creature when danger threatens Then I noticed that the camp was flooded by a peculiar light  The sand and dust around the camp were phosphorescing in a flood of bluish sparks  Half asleep as I was I took the phenomenon for pieces of quartz sparkling in the moonlight before I remembered that we were not on Earth and the two moons of Mars were just two small dots shining among the millions of stars in the sky  The captain and Sheldon had woken up too I could tell who they were by the numbers on their suits  They were walking around the Green Lizard like two dark shadows and I was surprised to see little blue flames flickering at the tops of their helmets where the little radio masts were fitted  I remembered the storm at Sion  A moment later I saw a mass of little flames flickering over the Green Lizard too the tractor was spitting out streams of blue sparks from every corner and angle  The crackling in our earphones had woken the whole crew by now  The blue flames went out only to flare up again in a strange silent dance which had something provocative and beautiful about it  Then there was a bright flash that lit up the whole sky followed by a muffled explosion  All at once it was pitch dark  The little blue flames had gone and the velvety black of night fell over the dunes again  The storm that broke over our camp then was the worst we had yet known  The winds first onslaught sounded like a thundering waterfall  Very soon the trailers and the Green Lizard were completely covered in dust  The elements raged for three hours and the sudden silence that followed was so unnatural that we dared not loosen our safety ropes  All we could do was wait for morning in the impenetrable darkness  Our premonitions were well founded  The dim light of morning did not come  Instead several violet flashes rent the black stifling darkness and another furious dust storm soon broke over us  This storm was devastating in fact it was lucky that the trailers were already buried in the sand for if the storm had got hold of them their loads would have been scattered far and wide and that would have sealed the fate of the expedition  But no one had time to think of that just now  The oxygen packs were functioning well and they and the safety ropes were the only things that kept us alive  Later when the storm died down we crawled out of the dust drifts like exhausted ravenous beetles and in the twilight we shovelled the dust away to get at our oxygen and provisions  Over twenty-four hours had passed since the storm first broke and we still had not heard from OBriens group  However it was gradually becoming day though the murky dim light made us feel as if we were at the bottom of a deep ravine  Laboriously we cleared the dust from the trailers on the sides away from the wind  We left their other sides buried in the sand just in case       Neither base nor OBriens group made radio contact with us until at last after three days OBrien sent back a message  The storm had taken them by surprise too in open country  The captain told OBrien to come back with his party as soon as the weather improved  OBrien did not reply to that  They did not say a word about Lawrenson and the Dragonfly as if the subject were taboo  I was sure neither of them expected to see Lawrenson again  We were still counting up the days of possible life remaining to him but we already knew his life was over  Sometimes he did appear in our memories but not in his rigid spacesuit or beside the crashed Dragonfly or covered in dust and sandwe remembered him clean-shaven and dapper as ever saying Well boys where do we go today        The wind whistled incessantly over the camp as the monotonous periods of light and dark alternated  And so Lawrensons ten days ran out  CHAPTER 25 Even after those ten days we could not make radio contact with base  The one nerve still keeping us in touch was the direction finder  The wind kept chasing yellowish grey clouds over the sky but it was no longer quite so fierce directly over the dunes  Visibility was bad but we could have gone on  All the same we stayed three more days in this bleak spot  The captain had not given up hope that OBriens party would change their minds and turn back  Over the radio we got the impression that something was wrong in the group and OBrien was concealing it  Exactly what had happened Was someone ill Had they lost their supplies The captain asked straight out and was told that everything was all right except that the going was very difficult  Three days later the captain gave up  He told OBrien we were turning back  In his bitterness he called OBrien an irresponsible madman  We loaded the supplies on two trailers and left the third one empty beside the now defunct Red Lizard which began to look like the skeleton of some prehistoric animal  One last glance at the inhospitable spot where we had left part of our lives and the Green Lizard set out  It would hardly be called morning except according to the clock and everything looked quite unreal apart from the eddies of dust disappearing into the fog  So began a journey that was accompanied by the constant desperate and monotonous calculation of our oxygen and food supplies  It took us three days to tow the trailers laboriously to the foot of the Barrier  Our progress after that was snail-like  Compton and I tested the ground ahead of the Green Lizard with metal rods  The rocky country full of dust-filled craters seemed to be lying in wait to swallow us up as we crawled on like robots  My brain was trying to persuade my body that it was no use moving  Why torment ones muscles with movements that were doing nothing but move a small collection of bones and flesh three hundred kilometres further north Three hundred kilometres of cruel exertion for something that didnt exist  The base Yes that was something to cling tobut the mere word was not enough       Perhaps all this was just a dream this dreadful stumbling staggering forward movement the endless shovelling of sand and on top of it all the fear of a greedy trap hidden in the dust  Perhaps it was a dreadful mindless dream and all the time there was grass not sand under my feet  When I woke up Id hear a stream trickling and see old alder trees with dippers nesting among their roots Id see black and white cows grazing in the distance and huge fat clouds in the sky above them full of rain gentle rain which would fall softly and moisten my bare feet and wash off the dust       The dust It brought me right back to my senses  There was an alarm signal up in front  Radcliff had fallen into a drift  The captain and Sheldon pulled him out on a rope and I prayed that he wasnt hurt  In the poor visibility it was not surprising that we could not find the way we had crossed the Barrier  The slope we were climbing was no steeper than our original route and the ground no rougher but when the Green Lizard stuck on the scree slope for the third time we considered detaching one of the trailers  But the captain seemed possessed by a spirit of avariceor perhaps he was anticipating further losses  He refused to give up a single kilogram of our supplies though now that the Red Lizard had fallen out we had more fuel than we needed  He suggested towing one trailer to the ridge of the Barrier and then going back for the other  But the area was vast and the visibility bad enough already could become worse so one man would have to stay behind with the second trailer to fire signal rockets at fixed times  Provided no major complications arose the Green Lizard could be back by evening of the next day  There were two flaws in this plan first only one man was to stay with the trailer so that the group would not be unduly weakened if anything unforeseen happened and second if the weather did suddenly get worse it was quite possible that that one mans thirty-six hours solitude might turn into a nerve-racking period of solitary confinement lasting several days  It was an unpleasant prospect to say the least of it but Gray volunteered at once  He could not do any physical work because of his injured knee and his conscience was nagging him because ever since his accident he was less use to the expedition than a container of fuel to put it ruthlessly  So he grasped eagerly at the chance to make himself useful  The captain who must have been aware of his reasons hesitated briefly and then agreed  It wont be exactly a relaxing weekend though James he said  I dont envy you  I can always play patience said Gray with a gleam of humour  And if theres a storm Ill just light a candle put up the shutters and have a nice cup of tea  His joke sounded as forced and embarrassing as the painful merriment of a drunk when youre stone cold sober  I realised that we just couldnt see the funny side of things any morewe had about as much sense of humour as a set of robots  Every time I tried to look at my own or my companions behaviour from a psychological point of view the effort required seemed an unnecessary strain  Every now and then I did remind myself of my function in the expedition but only reluctantly as if from a distance  Over the last few days Id been feeling pressure somewhere in the lower part of my skull and the nape of my neck the spot where fear seems to crawl       The viciousness of the pain confused me  I tried to work out what was causing it  But all I could bring myself to do was to glance at the rocks stones and dust stretching out ahead and I had the strange feeling that the beings moving around me with such difficulty were not human at all and the voices I heard were just recordings made on some other world  When we set off after unhitching the trailer we left Gray leaning against it waving to us  I looked back as long as I could make out any movement in the fog among the rocks  We managed to scale the south-east slope of the Barrier by evening  Meanwhile the dust haze had lifted a good deal  The setting sun flamed on the ridge of the Barrier like fire and the red dusty atmosphere glowed like a huge lava field  It was a wonderful sight but what occupied our minds at the moment was the fact that even from this high point we could not get into radio contact with base  What had happened We were receiving transmissions though weakly from the Yellow Lizard on the other side of the Barrier  OBrien told us that they were trying to get through a belt of dust swamps  He spoke disconnectedly and we were cut off before he had finished  We didnt know what to think  The stars shown that night but next morning a strong north wind was blowing over the smooth rocks of the Barrier again and yellowish dust clouds were dancing wildly on the side away from the wind  We couldnt get back to the second trailer for the time being and the thought of Gray left there on his own was worrying  The weather did not improve at all that day the captain had decided to wait a maximum of another twenty-four hours and then go back for the second trailer whatever the weather  However the wind died down overnight and in the morning the sun was shining  The Barrier was a beautiful sight glittering with rose-pink hoarfrost  We had to leave someone with the first trailer up on top of the Barrier to send up rockets and I volunteered I dont know why  Perhaps it was my headache  Perhaps I needed peace  So the captain Sheldon and Compton set out with the Green Lizard leaving me behind in the lonely fantastic landscape  I sat down on the ground beside the trailer my back to a rock looking out at the vast desert all around me  I was the middle of it all now I was the centre of my own private universe  I thought about that but my thoughts were not very profound  I was wondering which came first the urge to keep moving circling changing or the urge to stop moving altogether and lapse into the bliss of immobility for ever  At evening on the second day the Green Lizard got safely back with Gray and the second trailer  And at last after many days as if the Barrier really were a barrier between hope and despair we heard from base  The transmitting equipment had been badly damaged by electrical explosions during the last storm  Trott was doing well  Silcott asked how the Dragonflys flight of exploration had gone  This was an opening for the captain to tell them the truth  Watts who was at the transmitter back at base repeated the question  Still the captain said nothing  Are you receiving me Captain Watts asked again  I asked about Lawrensons flight  Yes I know said the captain  There was a long pause  At last Watts spoke again  I see was all he said  Then there was another long silence  The rest of the conversation was brief and official  The captain did not want news of Lawrensons flight sent back to Mission Control before the whole crew could discuss the tragic affair back at base  Later we were in contact with OBriens party again  The Yellow Lizard had reached country that was completely impassable  Again the captain asked OBrien to turn back suggesting that we could wait for him on top of the Barrier and send up flares  OBrien did not say what he thought of this plan he merely said he was going to try to skirt around the difficult area making a detour to the south-east  Infuriated by OBriens really pathological obstinacy the captain prophesied doom for the whole party and told his second-in-command acidly to try and remember that he wasnt pursuing his obsession on his own  Unfortunately not replied OBrien and then we were cut off  We discussed this remark and decided it must mean that there were differences of opinion within the group which made us worry about them more than ever  The long-term wearing of spacesuits was becoming more and more of a trial and it was bad for everyones health so we decided not to wait for OBriens party at the Barrier  We could use the enforced period of waiting to recuperate at Sion on the way back  Next day we were driving slowly down the northwest slope of the Barrier when the ground suddenly gave way under the Green Lizards second trailer and it tipped over on to the slope  It was on the edge of a crater  Containers of fuel and crates of provisions tumbled downhill in a cloud of dust and at the same moment the Green Lizard itself pulled by the weight of both trailers lurched sideways  Sheldon tore frantically at the hooks on the ropes shouting to us to run back up the slope  Moving pon- derously we all got back from the edge of the crater  A low rumbling noise was corning from it  Compton and I were dragging the crippled Gray  When at last the clouds of dust settled we saw the scattered remains of our supplies and the ruins of the trailer down below among the debris of the avalanche of stones  The Green Lizard was stranded hanging over the edge of the rock and looking like a tired horse taken out of harness  There was no wind at all and the sun was shining brightly  CHAPTER 26 There was no wind at all for a great many days after that  It was the longest period of atmospheric calm that Morphy had recorded  We dragged ourselves down to the rocks at the bottom of the ravine salvaging the remains of our supplies  Almost everything had been destroyed or was lying buried somewhere under the rocks  When we added it all up the results were meagre food and drink for about fourteen days if we all had normal rations two tanks of fuel for the tractor and oxygen for eight days provided our packs were not switched to Full which meant we had to avoid physical exertion and economise on breathing  Fear was real enough now no ghost in the subconscious  Somewhere beneath our feet lay the metal cylinders of chemicals  Unfortunately we had no idea just where  Fear attacked our bodies and minds  We felt like rushing at the avalanche hurling the stones aside looking for the treasure that lay buried there so pointlessly for all eternity  Instead we sat discussing what to do our limbs alarmingly heavy  Should we make for Sion where there were oxygen reserves With a bit of luck we might reach the Astra in six days just about as long as our oxygen would hold out if we were physically active even if we took turns riding in the one remaining trailer  However it was not in the captains nature to count on luck and he vetoed any attempt to reach Sion  As our air ran out with every breath we drew we frantically weighed up how much luck we needed how many risks we would be taking  Luck didnt seem to be on our side luck was a slippery customer  Finally we agreed on what seemed the most sensible course we would call OBriens group to our aid and while we ourselves economised on every movement and every breath of air they could reach us within five days guided by the signal rockets we would send up from the summit of the Barrier  With the crippled Gray and the remains of the supplies I drove up to the low hill where we had decided to camp  Captain Norton Compton and Sheldon dragged themselves slowly along behind us counting every breath  Before the sun sank below the black line of the horizon we were all there  Now there was nothing to do but lie still and try not to use up our air  The captain wanted me to talk to OBrien when his party made radio contact and I thought I knew why  It was a bitter pill for him to have to ask OBrien of all people for help  But it was a few moments before I grasped what the real reason was  I described our present gloomy situation and asked OBrien to return to the Barrier with his party as fast as he could  He said nothing for a moment then he replied calmly Sorry Cosby Im not taking this psychological bait of yours You and the captain will have to think up something better than that Then I was cut off  We spent a whole hour trying to raise some sign of life in our earphones but there was nothing but the lifeless desert  At last the Yellow Lizard did make a transmission  McKinley spoke to us  He seemed to be upset about something and asked for the captain  I connected the microphone cable to the captains helmet but the connection was cut again at once and that was the end of that  We just lay there among the rocks that shone dully in the soft light  Next morning we decided to stake everything on one card  We would try to reach Sion  Then the Yellow Lizard made contact with OBrien at the transmitter  He asked to speak to the captain  I know this is all a clever trick he said  Very clevertheres no possible way I can check up on it  I dont seem to have any discipline or authority in this party either  All right I surrender  Im handing over to McKinley  Then McKinley talked to us asking us to send up rockets in exactly fifteen minutes time  He thought they were forty kilometres away from the Barrier as the crow flies and in clear weather they ought to see the fight of the rockets  Sorry we have to save our rockets said the captain  All right said McKinley  This evening then  No not todaywe have to save them for bad weather  We only have fourteen rockets left  Thats not too bad said McKinley  Say five days marchthats eight rockets a day  Well make that do  Youve got it wrong  I said fourteen not forty  Thats hardly three a day  McKinley said nothing obviously unable to think of anything to comfort us  He ended the transmission  We were still lying among the rocks  In the thin clear atmosphere we could see the ridge of the Barrier standing out sharply against the pale violet sky  Dusty deserts stretched as far as the eye could see a hollow inventory of names that had once sounded so romanticAeria and Arabia and Moab and Edom on the other side  They dried up our throats they crunched between our teeth like sand   I closed my eyes to make them go away  Next day was just the same  Nothing changed either in the landscape or the sky  During our evening radio transmission to OBriens party we sent up the first rocket and McKinley told us exultantly that he could see its green light  He located the exact direction and fixed the time for the next transmission  I realised that McKinley had not answered when the captain asked how many kilometres they had come  The captain who was not easily taken in asked again  The goings hard said McKinley  Theres a lot of dust here  We have six days left  I just hope you can make it said the captain  I woke in the night thinking I heard the rumble of a storm  The sky was clear still and full of stars  Nothing happened it was only the beating of my heart  In silence I watched the hoarfrost vanish off the rocks around me in the morning sun  A veil of mist barely   visible trembled above the carbon dioxide ice crystals as they dispersed  Radcliff suggested that we might climb down into the crater to look for oxygen containers  Gray could stay up on the hill and look after the radio equipment and the signal rockets  The captain vetoed this idea saying that it was more futile to go searching at random in the avalanche of stones than to stay here not moving and saving oxygen  At midday Radcliff repeated his suggestion offering to go down alone  Suppose he was lucky       Prospectors have to count on luck you know he said  Were not in Alaska now said the captain firmly and he warned Radcliff not to talk more than necessary it wasted oxygen  No one spoke a word until evening  Our evening rocket shone in the sky like a green star of hope  Five days left  When we woke next morning Radcliffs place was empty  His footprints showed in the hoarfrost going downhill  The captain made no comment  Apart from our radio contacts with the other group we did not hear a word in our earphones all day long but the hours of inaction which would normally have seemed endless fell like over-ripe fruits from the tree of time  Towards evening the exhausted Radcliff came back  He was carrying an empty battered fruit juice can  God knows why he bothered with it  I have only one thing to say to you said the captain  Youve robbed us all of several hours life  I wanted to give you a surprise said Radcliff dully  But theres nothing down there but stones just stones       McKinley called us earlier than usual to say that the Yellow Lizard might reach the south-east side of the Barrier by tomorrow evening if the weather held and nothing unforeseen happened  We still have ninety hours replied the captain in as unemotional a voice as possible  Fine replied McKinley with forced cheerfulness  We kept an eye on Radcliff who was acting strangely  At times it seemed that he was going to run down to the ruins of the trailerthen he would look towards the south-east slope of the Barrier again urging us to go and meet the Yellow Lizard  McKinley made radio contact at midday  The Yellow Lizard had stuck in the dust for three hours that morning so the party could not reach the foot of the Barrier until evening  At this news Radcliff succumbed to a fit of hysterical weeping and I gave him a strong sedative  Once again the evening rocket bathed the ridge of the Barrier in its green light and we heard McKinleys excited voice in our earphones  Some time later as we were staring into the black darkness to the south-east we thought we saw signals from the Yellow Lizards searchlights in the distance  We argued about itwere they optical illusions or hallucinations caused by our over-wrought senses No they couldnt be for we were all seeing the rhythmical flashes at the same time  At ten in the evening we heard McKinley again  The group had reached the foot of the Barrier but the men were half dead with exhaustion  Weve got over sixty hours left said the captain  Better rest till morning  McKinley said they would rest for an hour then unhitch the trailerOBrien was going to stay with itand drive on  Thats an unnecessary risk there are craters full of dust there the captain objected  If Vaux and Thompson go ahead with probes itll be all right  Well be with you by morning  For Gods sake will you do as I say shouted the captain  I forbid you to move on Yes all right said McKinley and he cut us off  An hour later we saw the Yellow Lizards lights again  They were moving barely perceptibly crawling like insignificant glowworms over the black patch that was the Barrier  I felt my heart beat wildly  By midnight the lights were so clear that we could see the ground lit up ahead of the Yellow Lizard  But for the treacherous pits full of dust drifts we would have run down the hill to meet them  We turned the Green Lizard so that its own lights were facing those of the Yellow Lizard switched them on and waited  And all the time the lights appeared and disappeared again in the distance as the tractor wound its way through groups of rocks and round craters of dust the stars wheeled like a vast astronomical clock overhead  At four in the morning the others went out to meet the Yellow Lizard its lights now cutting through the dark  I didnt want to leave the disabled Gray alone so we leaned against each other watching the spacesuited figures move in the blinding cone of light cast by the searchlights and I had the feeling that the purpose of suffering anger fear and sickness is only to surprise us from time to time by showing us how little we really need to make us happy  CHAPTER 27 Its difficult to decide exactly when the Great March really came to an end  Perhaps at the moment when we were caught in the dust storm after going three hundred and forty kilometres Or when Lawrenson flying over Sinus Sabaeus sent back his last radio message Or when OBrien handed over command of his party to McKinley Or perhaps it did not end until the engine of the last tractor finally stopped for the last time back at base Perhaps it was because of the machines we failed perhaps it was the men  One thing was certain when we brought the necessities of life and all our technological equipment up from Earth we had also brought the germs of that illness to which we all succumbed  Of course it would be pleasant to blame everything on this illness which afflicts all mankind but it would be just as wrong to torment ourselves with self-reproaches  Were surrounded by uncertainty all our lives the one sure thing is that everything has some point  When the captain and OBrien met up on top of the Barrier neither of them blamed the other neither made any excuses or offered any thanks  Both had lost far too much to begin again from the beginning  It took us five days to reach Sion and at last we could allow ourselves to relax for a while  It was quiet under those rocky battlements  No wind shook the cabin no storm raged over the desert  Clear dark nights followed bright clear days and that was all  Day after day week after week the direction finder led us along the weary monotonous way back to base  The trails of men and tractors wrote the history of the Great March in the dust  One day the weather broke the wind reviving raised the dust chased it over the crests of the dunes and wiped out our tracks  The wind blew the machines went on working and the men lived on as if nothing could ever be different  At last the steel structures of the base camp loomed up out of the dust haze  Machines and men stopped  The Great March was finally over  And as the planet turned in an icy silence the wind obliterated every trace of us  We were all together againall but Williams and Lawrenson  I had plenty of time for thinking now though Watts and I had our hands full treating the rashes and ugly festering sores which were the result of wearing spacesuits for so long  Everything seemed reasonably normal to me  Grays knee was badly injured the surgeons would be putting him through it when he got back to Earth  Trott was disabled too toes had been amputated on both feet and the results of his longterm lack of oxygen were telling on him  Briggs had frequent attacks of faintness and nausea  None of us was really fit  The captain kept himself to himself more than ever before and OBrien was not talking to anyone  On the other hand Radcliff who talked all the time was quite unbearable it was as if he were catching up on something he had done without for a long time  McKinley had stopped making jokes  Perhaps he was brooding over the loss of that heap of stones he had collected at the risk of his life and left somewhere in the desert beyond the Barrier       wed all lost something  Now that I had enough food and air I could manage to think about it all more clearly  About myself too  My thoughts were not exactly cheering but not hopeless eitherone just had to find the right criterion by which to judge things  Did I fail or was it psychology I think it was psychology the psychology of Earthmen  It had other norms other standards and now I believed I understood the spirit of this planet so different from Earth  I came to the conclusion that we cant conquer new worlds by expecting them to suit themselves to us we must suit ourselves to them  I dreamed of a future in which we would not need to drag tons of oxygen and supplies with us on spaceflights to other planets since it is not impossible to alter the composition of our blood our method of breathing the temperature of the body and its chemical changes the rhythm of sleep and waking  Then I thought what does a dream come true really mean Here we were on Mars and we didnt find green monsters crawling about or ancient canals reflecting the roofs of Martian cities in their dark waters not even a Martian Atlantis covered with sand  Our time on Mars was a long record of endless and monotonous toil  We still had thirty days to go before the flight home  The Martian autumn set in calm and clear  OBrien would sit for hours in the dome of the observatory  He looked very illit wasnt just that he was so thin but there was a disquietingly absent expression in his eyes as if he looked out of another world  Or into another world Whenever I tried to probe the mystery I ran up against an impenetrable wall of silence so I was surprised when one day he asked me to go to the observatory with him  It was perfectly quiet in there  Can you hear anything asked OBrien  All I could hear was his breathing  Listen he urged me  Listen hard Then he said he could hear musical notes  They sound like organ music he said looking right through me with his cold absent eyes  There was no wind outside  It may be the humming of the blood in your ears I said  The sounds inside your own head  Can one establish an aural hallucination objectively OBrien asked me straight out  Suppose I just have better hearing than you For Gods sake dont go talking yourself into any- thing like that  Itd be more sensible to admit that youre ill  You mean Im off my head  I wouldnt put it like that       OBrien closed his eyes wearily  We none of us have enough courage to go on to the very end he said  Perhaps thats where it all is right at the very end       suppose everythings much simpler than we think I was trying to prove the existence of life on Mars I failedbut suppose it doesnt lie in immensely complicated groupings of hydrogen and carbon atoms suppose its in the harmony in the tonal system the music notes arranged according to a unique and simple key A final life-giving harmony   As I looked out at the bleak desert I saw in my minds eye a sudden picture of the wreck of the Dragonfly covered with dustand a flock of bright butterflies fluttering above it  CHAPTER 28 The dream that had come true for us four hundred and forty days before had been maturing for many years  We had landed on the planet Mars where we found out that a dream come true is a hard thing  A single real stone is heavier than a whole imaginary mountain  But over that four hundred and forty days a new dream matured the dream of leaving all we had dreamed of and going back to Earth  Everything had changed  Our longing for the unknown had turned to a longing for familiarity  The module which was going to take us back to Earth was resting on the lower stage of the mother ship  All parts connecting them had been dismantled  The miraculously powerful rocket motors which were to send us back to the sight of the blue sky and trees and cities full of living talking human beings were waiting for the green light  The schedules of interplanetary flight mean that any inexactitude is cruelly punished  Like any other discipline space flight is cold indifferent recognising no impatience or longing no dreams  There were three possible times when the module could take off three moments in the orbit of the Martin moon Phobos on which we had to land before we could take off for Earth its orbiting time was seven hours thirty-nine minutes and thirteen seconds  Missing the vital moment on the last of the three orbits in question would mean missing the last train and the penalty for that in space is death  So as the day the hour and the second approached we began to worry about any detail that might cause such a fatal delay  The whole return journey literally hung on a thread of wire as thin as silk  Nothing had gone the way we planned it  Not a thing from the moment of our landing and even before and it was the same until the moment we took off and even afterwards  On the four hundred and fortieth day three hours before lift-off we were standing on the dusty ground of Mars to pay our last respects to the memory of Williams and Lawrenson  A slight but constant wind crinkled the surface of the desert and the blood-red fireworks of the setting sun lit the scene  But OBrien was not among the group of silent men  No one had any idea what was making him behave so callously  At that moment I despised him  Then it occurred to me that I might be doing him an injustice  OBrien was ill  Something could have happened to him  I remembered last seeing him in the pressure chamber as we checked our spacesuits  I was the last but one there was only OBrien after me  Then the captains orders to make final preparations for lift-off brought me out of my thoughts  When we went back into the pressure chamber OBrien was not there  He was not in the clubroom or any of the cabins of the module either  He did not reply to our radio calls  The captain summoned me to his cabin and when I came in he pointed to the open log book  It was open at an unfinished page and a few sprawling words had been written in unusually large letters  After a while I managed to make them out  The greatness of life is in its lack of meaningthe whole meaning of life is to deny it  William OBrien  The captain let the first lift-off go by and ordered us to search every room in the camp  By now it was night  We looked for tracks in the sand by electric light but apart from our own footsteps outside the pressure chamber which were gradually disappearing beneath the drifting dust we found nothing but the certainty that if he had left the base an hour ago his tracks would be gone by now  At frequent intervals the captain transmitted orders to OBrien not to endanger the lives of the whole expedition by his conductand at that moment I realised why all our misadventures had grown to such huge proportions  The captain was never just a man he was always a commander and a soldier  Perhaps he didnt even know that it means more to be a man  Two Lizards with lights at full beam searched the desert around the base for three hours  The captain talked to Mission Control about the possibility of taking off at the second scheduled time  The modules booster engines were already running  It was to take off at twenty minutes after three in the morning  There were just two hours left  The cones of light cast by the searchlights shone over the desolate dunes and were lost in the eddying dust  We heard the captain cancel lift-off for the second time  A hot wave of fear overcame me I could not help wondering what would happen if some complication set in during our manoeuvres on the satellite Phobos  We could lose the possibility of return to Earth  For ever  I wondered if the hope of finding OBrien outweighed the risk we were taking the risk of seventeen lives  Was it really right to endanger the lives of the others to rescue one man I felt anger and disgust at my own weakness too  I knew it would be a weakness to give up our rescue attempts so long as there was any hope at all  As a doctor I cant agree that every man has a right to dispose of his own life as he wishes but then again I had to ask what right anyone has to dispose of someone elses life  The uncomfortable part of all this was not knowing how much my fears for my own life were influencing me  The captain kept transmitting orders to OBrien insisting forcibly upon his authority  I listened with growing distaste  His radio calls were all empty phrases about responsibility and right  They upset me  Then suddenly I heard his voice sound quite different  Bill I beg you be reasonable come back Youre destroying the rest of my life   A six-man group led by Radcliff asked the captain to lift off at the second scheduled time  They said there was no point in the expeditions sacrificing itself for a madman  The captain did not reply to them nor did he reverse his decision  We spent the rest of the night arranging living conditions for the voluntary exile  Perhaps it was pointless and cruel to lengthen a mans life by fifty days when he had absolutely no chance of living a single day longer once the oxygen was finished  But even doctors operate on hopeless cases just to prolong their lives by a few days conscience is a judge who cannot be bribed  We knew that if we did not find OBrien he could live at base for some two hundred days always supposing he wanted to  The air-conditioned clubroom which was now serving as a lift-off ramp was undamaged  There was a years fuel for the electric power plant food and drink for at least six months  But not the least hope of escape  When it began to get light we searched every room in the base once more  Three parties searched the sand dunes around the camp  A slight wind was blowing playing with the dust in the hazy sunlight  An hour before lift-off we were all in our anti-gravitation seats and the metal of the ship was vibrating gently as the booster engines ran  Time crept by like an animal with a broken backbone  I was strapped tight into my seat and the thoughts were whirling in my head like a flock of ravens in the wind of early spring  Perhaps that was what the tense atmosphere meantit meant spring  At eleven hours six minutes thirty seconds Mars Time the rocket motors fired  CHAPTER 29 I was aware of my own existence  The pressure on my chest and my headache receded I was hovering in a calm pleasant no-mans-land  Dimensions and shapes were changed  Everything was losing weight  A curtain seemed to go up before an imaginary white screen and film sequences ran before my eyes  There was a man in a spacesuit on a hill  And the desert shining on the far horizon and a pillar of fire rising from the dust clouds  Gradually it climbed higher gathering speed shot vertically upwards and finally disappeared among the bright stars  The man stood there for a long time legs apart motionless alone while the sun wheeled over the dark sky       Then there was another picture the sun dipped into a fiery sea behind the black shape of an antenna mast  The man was standing by a low stone grave mound and a dull red glow fell on his spacesuit  Then the desert swallowed up the sun  The man went into his steel house  Thin veils of mist rose above the far horizon spreading pale light over the dark landscape  Nothing moved but for an icy wind whistling over the vast expanses now plunged in darkness driving dust over the dunes  Then a light came on behind a small round window throwing a warm glow on the dust as it whirled and eddied away       and then there was writing on the screen  The End  The end of the dream of Mars  So I thought about that film  Perhaps OBriens remark about the whole meaning of life was not meant cynically  Perhaps the whole meaning of life really does consist in an eternal battle to prove that it is significant  '"

    "# Section Texts By Chapter Headings\n",
    "When working with texts with clearly delineated chapters, using chapter headings is a relatively easy way to section texts into segments of (relatively) the same size. After checking the chapter counts for each text to confirm whether sectioning by chapter is a useful procedure, this code iterates through the texts and splits them each time it encounters a new \"chapter\" heading. From here, the text from each chapter is appended to a new dataframe and denoted by book and chapter number. "
